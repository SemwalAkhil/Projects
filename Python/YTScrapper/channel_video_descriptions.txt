Delusions [Phenomenology, Types, Neurobiology, Theories and Treatment] 

Understanding Delusions: Phenomenology, Types, Neurobiology, Theories, and Treatment

Introduction:
Delusions represent a fascinating yet challenging aspect of psychiatric research and clinical practice. These fixed, false beliefs, often resistant to contradictory evidence, can significantly impair an individual's functioning and quality of life. This essay aims to provide an overview of delusions, exploring their phenomenology, types, neurobiology, theories, and treatment modalities.

Phenomenology:
Delusions are characterized by their firmness, incorrigibility, and lack of congruence with cultural or religious beliefs. They typically involve themes of persecution, grandiosity, reference, control, and somatic experiences. Persecutory delusions, for example, involve beliefs of being targeted or harassed, while grandiose delusions entail inflated self-importance or abilities. Delusions of reference involve the conviction that neutral stimuli hold personal significance, and delusions of control relate to the belief that external forces manipulate one's thoughts or actions. Somatic delusions involve false beliefs regarding bodily functions or sensations.

Types of Delusions:
Delusions can be categorized based on their content, duration, and associated psychiatric conditions. Primary types include paranoid, grandiose, somatic, erotomanic, jealous, and nihilistic delusions. Additionally, delusions may occur in the context of schizophrenia, mood disorders, substance-induced psychosis, or neurological conditions like dementia.

Neurobiology:
The neurobiology of delusions is complex and multifactorial. Neuroimaging studies suggest alterations in brain regions implicated in perception, emotion regulation, and cognitive processing, including the prefrontal cortex, limbic system, and subcortical structures. Dysregulation of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of delusions, particularly in schizophrenia.

Theories:
Various theoretical frameworks attempt to elucidate the origins and maintenance of delusions. The cognitive model posits that delusions arise from faulty reasoning processes, such as jumping to conclusions or attributing significance to random events. The neurodevelopmental model proposes that early disruptions in brain development predispose individuals to later psychotic experiences. Socio-cultural factors, including migration, urbanicity, and social adversity, also influence the expression of delusions.

Treatment:
Treatment approaches for delusions encompass pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and psychosocial interventions. Antipsychotic medications, targeting dopamine receptors, remain the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment for psychotic disorders. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to challenge and restructure delusional beliefs by promoting reality testing and cognitive flexibility. Psychosocial interventions focus on enhancing social support, coping skills, and functional recovery.

Conclusion:
Delusions represent a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with significant implications for psychiatric research and clinical practice. Understanding their phenomenology, neurobiology, and treatment options is essential for providing effective care to individuals experiencing delusional beliefs. Continued research efforts aimed at unraveling the underlying mechanisms of delusions and developing innovative therapeutic strategies are crucial for improving outcomes in this challenging clinical domain

Paragliding in Swiss: Above the Clouds, Wings of Freedom, and Phenomenal Beauty

I made a decision‚Äîa decision that I‚Äôll never forget. Choosing to paraglide in Interlaken was the best choice I‚Äôve ever made. üôå‚ú® It‚Äôs more than just an adventure; it‚Äôs an experience that stays with you forever.

The moment my feet left the ground, I knew this was different. It wasn‚Äôt just about flying‚Äîit was about becoming one with the sky.... The sensation of the wind carrying you, the air rushing past, and that feeling of weightlessness‚Äîit‚Äôs soothing, almost meditative. Up there, with nothing but the clouds and wind, it felt like time slowed down. You feel free, like you're suspended between the earth and the heavens, floating gently, like an eagle with wings wide open. 

And the view‚Ä¶ oh, the view! üíô Below, the stunning blue waters of Lake Brienz and Lake Thun shimmered like jewels, nestled perfectly between the valleys. And in the distance, the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland, their peaks reaching up to touch the clouds, stood as silent giants, adding to the magic. üèîÔ∏è‚ú® It‚Äôs impossible to describe how breathtaking it was.....you simply have to feel it to understand.

As I glided, I realized there‚Äôs nothing quite like seeing the world from up there‚Äîfeeling the cool breeze, hearing only the sound of the wind, and being truly present in the moment. It‚Äôs like a reset button for your soul. This wasn‚Äôt just an adventure, it was freedom in its purest form.

If you're ever thinking of taking a leap‚Äîwhether it's paragliding or chasing another dream‚Äîgo for it. You‚Äôll find that sometimes, the scariest decisions lead to the most beautiful experiences. üíô

Medical Negligence by Doctors-in-training [Part 2] Research

Legal liability of medical undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students can vary depending on various factors including jurisdiction, circumstances of the case, and applicable laws and regulations. However, here are some key points to consider from a lawyer's perspective:

Standard of Care: Medical students, both UG and PG, are generally held to a standard of care expected of a reasonable medical professional with similar training and experience. This means that they are expected to perform tasks and make decisions in line with the standards taught in their medical education programs.

Supervision: The level of supervision provided to medical students can impact their legal liability. Generally, medical students are expected to work under the supervision of licensed healthcare professionals, such as attending physicians or resident physicians. If a medical student's actions result in harm to a patient, the level of supervision and the extent to which the supervisor delegated tasks responsibly may be considered in determining liability.

Scope of Practice: Medical students are typically limited in the scope of procedures and interventions they are allowed to perform, depending on their level of training and supervision. Performing tasks beyond their scope of practice or competence may increase their legal liability in case of adverse outcomes.

Informed Consent: In situations where medical students are involved in patient care, they may be required to obtain informed consent from patients or their legal representatives. Failure to adequately inform patients about procedures, risks, and alternatives could potentially lead to legal liability.

Documentation: Accurate and thorough documentation of patient encounters and procedures is essential for medical students to protect themselves legally. Proper documentation helps establish what actions were taken, the rationale behind those actions, and the patient's response.

Negligence and Malpractice: Like licensed healthcare professionals, medical students can be held liable for negligence or malpractice if their actions or omissions deviate from the standard of care and result in harm to a patient. Negligence is generally established by proving the existence of a duty of care, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.

Immunity: In some jurisdictions, medical students may be afforded certain legal protections or immunities when providing care under the supervision of licensed professionals in educational settings. However, the extent of such protections can vary, and it's essential to consult local laws and regulations.

Medical students should seek guidance from their educational institutions, supervisors, and legal professionals to understand their rights, responsibilities, and potential legal liabilities in clinical settings. Additionally, healthcare facilities and educational institutions should have protocols in place to ensure appropriate supervision, training, and risk management for medical students to minimize legal risks.

The courts have struggled with the question of what standard of care should govern resident conduct. The answer as to which standard should govern resident conduct is neither a precise, legal formulaic solution nor an entirely subjective determination that caters to perceived notions of fairness and justice. Instead, court rulings in this area of law have examined the various interests at stake such as the need to train future physicians, the accessibility of patients to the care provided in teaching hospitals, the information provided to patients about the training of their doctor, the relevance of such information (if any) to the treatment and outcome, the nature and role of the supervision of resident physician, and the responsibility of the supervising doctors and employer hospitals in monitoring resident conduct. 

A logical proposition would be to hold physicians in training to that standard which applies to the supervising physician. Such a legal rule will simplify the analysis, provide clear guidance to all parties, and be consistent with public expectations that resident conduct is monitored and supervised to ensure proper balancing of training, education, and patient safety. Resident liability already extends to supervising attending doctors and employer hospitals either directly or vicariously. The physician who directly supervises the professional conduct of a resident in a given situation should be recognized as the standard by which medical care delivered by the resident can be measured. Such a rule may be of value in identifying the legal standard by which to judge resident professional conduct in future legal cases.

The free fall‚Äîthe first few seconds are an explosion of exhilaration. The wind hits your face like a force of nature, hair whipping wildly, your body plummeting towards the earth at breakneck speed. For a moment, you feel like you‚Äôre falling through the clouds, engulfed by the sky, completely untethered. It‚Äôs just you, the open air, and that insane rush of adrenaline as gravity pulls you down.

Every second feels like a lifetime. The sheer intensity of free-falling, with nothing but the sky around you, is unlike anything you‚Äôve ever experienced. Your heart soars while your body drops‚Äîit‚Äôs a mix of fear, thrill, and the purest form of freedom.

Medical Negligence and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Act, 2023

Are doctors protected from criminal prosecution for medical negligence under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)?

Doctors will not be exempt from imprisonment if their negligent actions lead to the death of their patient. The new Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) ‚Äî passed by both Houses of the Parliament this session and meant to replace the Indian Penal Code ‚Äî still maintains a prison term of up to two years for death due to medical negligence.

When it comes to deaths caused by medical negligence, BNS does not change much. Cases of gross medical negligence, so far, were being registered under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code that stipulated up to two years of imprisonment, or fine, or both for the doctor responsible. While BNS increased the term of imprisonment up to five years for other categories of deaths caused by negligence such as traffic accidents.

As per the BNS Act 2023, Sec 106. (1) Whoever causes death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall also be liable to fine; and if such act is done by a registered medical practitioner while performing medical procedure, he shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, and shall also be liable to fine.

Doctors have a higher protection than normal citizens when it comes to death by negligence. Consider the case of ‚ÄòDr Suresh Gupta Vs Govt of NCT of Delhi,‚Äô where the patient died during surgery to correct a nasal deformity and the allegations were that the doctor did not use a proper ET tube to prevent bleeding. The Supreme Court had then said that the complaint against the doctor must show negligence or rashness of such a higher degree as to indicate mental state, which can be described as totally apathetic towards the patient. This decision was reiterated in the case of Dr Jacob Mathews where the court concluded that the negligence had to be of a very high order to condemn medical practitioners and must be addressed in consultation with expert opinion. 

Regarding Rash and Negligent act leading to simple injury (hurt) and grievous injury ...

125. Whoever does any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months or with fine which may extend to two thousand five hundred rupees, or with both, but‚Äî

(a) where hurt is caused, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to five thousand rupees, or with both;

(b) where grievous hurt is caused, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both

Parent Child Interaction Therapy [PCIT] for Disruptive Behaviour Disorders

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based intervention designed for young children (usually ages 2 to 7) and their parents or caregivers. PCIT is often used to address behavior problems in children and improve the parent-child relationship. Here are the key principles, steps, and the general process involved in PCIT:

Principles of PCIT:

Positive Reinforcement: PCIT emphasizes the use of positive reinforcement to strengthen the parent-child bond. Parents are encouraged to praise and reward positive behaviors.

Active Listening: Parents learn to actively listen to their child, promoting effective communication and understanding.

Child-Directed Interaction (CDI): During this phase, parents engage in child-led play to enhance the parent-child relationship and build a positive connection.

Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI): In this phase, parents are taught effective discipline techniques and strategies to manage their child's behavior in a positive way.

Consistency: Consistency in applying parenting techniques is crucial for the success of PCIT. Parents are encouraged to be consistent in their responses and expectations.

Steps in Parent-Child Interaction Therapy:

Assessment: The therapist conducts an initial assessment to understand the specific behavioral issues and challenges faced by the child and family.

Orientation: Parents receive information about PCIT, including its goals, principles, and the structure of the therapy sessions.

Child-Directed Interaction (CDI):

Teaching and Modeling: The therapist demonstrates child-led play techniques.
Coaching: Parents practice these techniques during therapy sessions, receiving real-time feedback and guidance.
Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI):

Teaching and Modeling: Parents learn effective discipline and behavior management techniques.
Coaching: Parents practice these techniques under the guidance of the therapist.
Graduation: Once parents demonstrate proficiency in both CDI and PDI, they "graduate" from PCIT. This signifies that they have acquired the skills necessary to manage their child's behavior independently.

Process of PCIT:

Orientation and Assessment: The therapy process begins with an introduction to PCIT and an assessment of the child's behavior.

Introduction to CDI: Parents are taught child-led play techniques that focus on enhancing the parent-child relationship.

CDI Practice Sessions: Parents engage in play sessions with their child under the guidance of the therapist, receiving coaching and feedback.

Transition to PDI: Once CDI skills are mastered, parents transition to learning and practicing effective discipline techniques.

PDI Practice Sessions: Similar to CDI, parents practice discipline techniques during therapy sessions, receiving feedback and guidance.

Generalization: Parents apply the learned skills at home, and the therapist provides ongoing support and guidance.

Graduation: When parents consistently demonstrate proficiency in both CDI and PDI, they graduate from PCIT, indicating the successful completion of the therapy.

It's important to note that PCIT is typically delivered by trained mental health professionals, and the therapy process may vary based on individual needs and circumstances. The therapist works collaboratively with parents to tailor the intervention to the specific needs of the child and family

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is a childhood behavioral disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior toward authority figures. Here's an overview of the diagnosis, prevalence, assessment, and treatment of Oppositional Defiant Disorder:

Diagnosis:

The diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a qualified mental health professional. The criteria for ODD are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with ODD, a child must exhibit a recurrent pattern of at least four of the following behaviors for at least six months:

Often loses temper.
Often argues with adults.
Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules.
Often deliberately annoys people.
Often blames others for their mistakes or misbehavior.
Is often touchy or easily annoyed by others.
Is often angry and resentful.
Is often spiteful or vindictive.
The behaviors must go beyond normal childlike oppositional behavior and cause significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.

Prevalence:

Oppositional Defiant Disorder is relatively common in children and adolescents. It often emerges in early childhood, with prevalence rates ranging from 1% to 11% in children and adolescents. Boys are more commonly diagnosed with ODD than girls. The disorder may co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, and mood disorders.

Assessment:

Assessment for Oppositional Defiant Disorder typically involves a combination of:

Clinical Interviews: Gathering information from the child, parents, and sometimes teachers to understand the nature and frequency of oppositional behaviors.

Behavioral Observation: Direct observation of the child's behavior in different settings, such as home and school.

Checklists and Rating Scales: Standardized tools and questionnaires completed by parents, teachers, or the child to assess the presence and severity of ODD symptoms.

Psychological Testing: In some cases, psychological testing may be conducted to assess cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, or other relevant factors.

It's important to rule out other potential causes for disruptive behaviors, such as trauma, environmental stressors, or learning disabilities.

Treatment:

Treatment for Oppositional Defiant Disorder often involves a multimodal approach that addresses the child's behavior, family dynamics, and environmental factors. Common interventions include:

Parent Management Training (PMT): Teaching parents effective strategies for managing and reinforcing positive behaviors in their child.

Behavioral Therapy: Individual or group therapy sessions focusing on the child's behavior, helping them develop coping skills and problem-solving abilities.

Counseling: Family counseling to improve communication and relationships within the family.

Social Skills Training: Helping the child develop appropriate social skills and interpersonal relationships.

School-based Interventions: Collaboration with teachers and school staff to create a supportive environment and address any academic challenges.

Medication: In some cases, medication may be considered, especially if co-occurring conditions like ADHD are present. Medication decisions should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.

The specific treatment plan will vary based on the individual needs and circumstances of the child and family. Early intervention and a collaborative approach involving parents, teachers, and mental health professionals are essential for effective management of Oppositional Defiant Disorder

Parent Management Training in treatment of Conduct Disorder [Oppositional Defiant Disorder] for Disruptive Behaviour Disorders

Parent Management Training (PMT) is a behavioral intervention designed to address behavior problems in children by focusing on improving parenting skills. PMT aims to teach parents effective strategies for managing their child's behavior and promoting positive parent-child interactions. Here are the key principles, steps, and the general process involved in Parent Management Training:

Principles of PMT:

Behavioral Approach: PMT is rooted in behavioral principles, emphasizing the role of reinforcement and consequences in shaping and modifying behavior.

Positive Reinforcement: The use of positive reinforcement is a central principle. Parents are taught to reinforce desired behaviors in their children through praise, rewards, or other positive consequences.

Consistency: Consistency in applying rules and consequences is crucial for the success of PMT. Parents are encouraged to be consistent in their responses to their child's behavior.

Communication Skills: PMT often includes teaching effective communication skills to enhance the parent-child relationship. This includes active listening and clear communication of expectations.

Problem-Solving: Parents are encouraged to engage in problem-solving and collaborate with their children to find solutions to behavioral challenges.

Steps in Parent Management Training:

Assessment: The therapist conducts an initial assessment to understand the specific behavior problems and challenges faced by the child and family.

Psychoeducation: Parents receive information about PMT, including its principles, goals, and the importance of consistent parenting.

Skill Building: Parents are taught specific parenting skills, including:

Positive Reinforcement: Encouraging and reinforcing positive behaviors.
Effective Discipline: Teaching appropriate consequences for undesirable behaviors.
Communication Skills: Enhancing communication within the parent-child relationship.
Role-Playing and Modeling: Therapists often use role-playing and modeling to help parents practice and understand the application of new skills.

Home Practice: Parents are encouraged to implement the learned skills at home and to keep track of their child's behavior and their responses.

Feedback and Adjustment: Parents receive feedback and support from the therapist based on their implementation of the skills. Adjustments to the strategies may be made as needed.

Generalization: Parents work on applying the learned skills to a variety of situations and settings, promoting generalization of positive behaviors.

Follow-Up and Maintenance: Ongoing support and follow-up sessions may be scheduled to address any new challenges and ensure the maintenance of positive changes.

Process of PMT:

Initial Contact and Assessment: The therapy process begins with an initial assessment of the child's behavior and the family's needs.

Psychoeducation and Goal Setting: Parents are educated about PMT principles, and goals for therapy are established collaboratively between the therapist and parents.

Skill Building: Parents learn and practice specific parenting skills in therapy sessions, addressing the identified behavior problems.

Implementation at Home: Parents implement the learned skills at home, keeping records of their child's behavior and their responses.

Feedback and Adjustment: The therapist provides feedback and helps parents make adjustments to their strategies based on their experiences at home.

Generalization: Parents apply the skills to different situations and settings, promoting generalization of positive behaviors.

Follow-Up: Ongoing support and follow-up sessions may be scheduled to address any new challenges and ensure the sustainability of positive changes.

It's important to note that PMT is often delivered by trained mental health professionals, and the therapy process may be tailored to meet the specific needs of the child and family. The effectiveness of PMT is often enhanced when parents actively participate and consistently apply the learned skills at home

Conduct Disorder : Diagnosis, Prevalence, Neurobiology, Assessment, Treatment and Prognosis

Conduct Disorder (CD) is a more severe and persistent pattern of disruptive behavior in children and adolescents. It involves a range of aggressive and antisocial behaviors that violate the rights of others and societal norms. Here's an overview of the diagnosis, prevalence, assessment, and treatment of Conduct Disorder:

Diagnosis:

The diagnosis of Conduct Disorder is made by mental health professionals based on the criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with CD, an individual must exhibit a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that falls into one of four main categories:

Aggression to people and animals: This includes behaviors such as bullying, fighting, physical cruelty to animals, and assault.

Destruction of property: Conduct that involves deliberate destruction of property, such as arson or vandalism.

Deceitfulness or theft: Repeated lying, shoplifting, breaking into someone's house, or other deceptive behaviors.

Serious violations of rules: Repeatedly engaging in behaviors that violate societal norms, such as truancy, running away, or substance abuse.

The behaviors must cause significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning and persist for at least six months.

Prevalence:

The prevalence of Conduct Disorder varies, but it is more common in males than females. It often emerges in childhood or adolescence, and its prevalence is estimated to be around 1-4% of children and adolescents. Conduct Disorder is associated with an increased risk of developing more severe antisocial behaviors and criminal activity later in life.

Assessment:

The assessment of Conduct Disorder involves a thorough evaluation by mental health professionals, including:

Clinical Interviews: Gathering information from the individual, parents, teachers, and other relevant sources to understand the nature and severity of the disruptive behaviors.

Behavioral Observation: Direct observation of the individual's behavior in different settings to assess the frequency and intensity of problematic behaviors.

Psychological Testing: Assessments to evaluate cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, and other relevant factors.

Checklists and Rating Scales: Standardized tools completed by parents, teachers, or the individual to assess the presence and severity of CD symptoms.

Assessment for Co-occurring Conditions: Evaluating the presence of co-occurring mental health conditions, such as ADHD, substance use disorders, or mood disorders.

Treatment:

The treatment of Conduct Disorder typically involves a comprehensive and individualized approach. Common interventions include:

Parent Management Training (PMT): Teaching parents effective strategies for managing and reinforcing positive behaviors in their child.

Individual and Family Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy or other therapeutic approaches to address underlying issues and improve coping skills.

Social Skills Training: Helping the individual develop appropriate social skills and problem-solving abilities.

School-based Interventions: Collaborating with teachers and school staff to create a supportive environment and address academic challenges.

Community Programs: Involving the individual in community-based programs that promote pro-social activities and positive peer relationships.

Medication: In some cases, medication may be considered, particularly if co-occurring conditions like ADHD or mood disorders are present. Medication decisions should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional.

Serial Killers [Part 4] Sexual Homicide: Humiliations and Mutilation

Sexual homicide refers to a criminal act in which an individual is killed as a result of a sexual motive or component. In these cases, the perpetrator's primary motivation typically involves sexual gratification, sadism, or control. Sexual homicide is a complex and devastating crime that involves both murder and a sexual component, making it a particularly heinous form of violence.

The motives behind sexual homicide can vary, and offenders may exhibit a range of behaviors associated with sexual sadism, power dynamics, or other deviant sexual interests. It's important to note that not all homicides with a sexual element are categorized as sexual homicides; specific criteria, such as the presence of sexual assault or clear evidence of a sexual motive, often guide the classification.

Researchers often try to categorize sexual homicides into different typologies based on the characteristics of the offenders and the nature of the crimes. This can help law enforcement professionals and mental health professionals develop effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Motivations: Understanding the motivations behind sexual homicides is crucial for developing profiles of offenders. Some common motivations include sexual sadism, power and control, or a combination of these factors. Research aims to uncover patterns and commonalities among offenders to aid in criminal profiling.

Dismemberment, particularly in the context of criminal acts such as homicides, is a complex behavior with varied causes. While motivations can differ among individuals, here are some potential reasons why dismemberment might occur:

Concealment of Evidence: Dismemberment is sometimes employed by offenders as a means to dispose of a body and reduce the chances of the victim being identified. By separating body parts and scattering them in different locations, the perpetrator aims to hinder forensic efforts to link the remains to the victim. It's important to note that dismemberment is not a behavior exclusive to serial killers, and motivations can vary widely among offenders. Criminal investigations and forensic analyses play a crucial role in understanding the specific circumstances surrounding each case and identifying the motives behind such acts. 

The mutilation and dismemberment of victims' bodies by some serial killers are behaviors that can be associated with various psychological, emotional, and pathological factors. It's important to note that not all serial killers engage in these specific actions, and motivations can vary widely among individuals. In certain cases, dismemberment is associated with post-mortem sexual acts or necrophilia. Offenders may engage in these behaviors to fulfill specific fantasies or satisfy aberrant sexual desires. Here are some potential reasons why certain serial killers may engage in mutilation and dismemberment:

Psychological Gratification:
For some serial killers, the act of mutilation and dismemberment is linked to their psychological gratification or sexual arousal. These behaviors may be part of their deviant fantasies and rituals, allowing them to derive pleasure or satisfaction from the gruesome acts.

Control and Power:
Mutilation and dismemberment can serve as a way for a serial killer to exert a heightened sense of control and power over their victims. These actions go beyond the act of killing itself and allow the offender to assert dominance and manipulate the victim's body in a way that extends the sense of power and possession.

Trophies and Souvenirs:
Some serial killers keep body parts as trophies or souvenirs, representing a tangible and macabre reminder of their crimes. These items may hold personal significance for the offender and can be used to relive the experience of the murder.

Expression of Anger and Hatred:
Mutilation and dismemberment can be an expression of the intense anger and hatred that some serial killers feel towards their victims. The act goes beyond the mere act of killing and allows the offender to physically vent their aggression and rage.

Fantasy Fulfillment:
Mutilation and dismemberment may be a way for certain serial killers to fulfill fantasies that they have harbored over an extended period. The act itself becomes an integral part of the offender's fantasy world.

Investigating and understanding sexual homicides involve collaboration between law enforcement, forensic psychologists, and other experts to analyze crime scenes, study offender behavior, and develop profiles that may aid in prevention and criminal apprehension. The legal consequences for individuals convicted of sexual homicide can be severe, often involving lengthy prison sentences or, in some jurisdictions, the death penalty.

Serial Killers [Part 2] Psychological Profiling [Behavioral Analysis of Serial Killer]

Psychological profiling, also known as criminal profiling or offender profiling, is a method used by criminal investigators to identify likely characteristics and traits of an unknown offender based on crime scene analysis and behavioral patterns. While it is not an exact science, it can provide valuable insights that may assist law enforcement in narrowing down potential suspects or focusing their investigations.

Here are key factors and methods involved in psychological profiling:

Crime Scene Analysis:

Profilers carefully examine the crime scene to understand the dynamics of the crime.
They look for patterns, evidence of planning, and indications of the offender's behavior during the crime.
Victimology:

Profilers consider information about the victims, including their demographics, relationships, and lifestyles.
Understanding the relationships between victims and offenders can provide insights into the motive and the offender's psychological state.
Offender Characteristics:

Profilers analyze the behavior exhibited during the crime, looking for consistent patterns.
Factors such as level of violence, method of approach, and the use of specific weapons can provide clues about the offender's personality.
Geographical Profiling:

Examining the locations of crimes can help identify a pattern and potentially narrow down the area where the offender may live or operate.
Behavioral Analysis:

Profilers assess behavioral aspects, including the offender's modus operandi (MO) and signature.
MO refers to the specific actions and methods used to commit a crime, while a signature is a unique, personal aspect added by the offender.
Crime Classification:

Profilers classify crimes into different categories, such as organized or disorganized, based on the characteristics observed.
This classification aids in understanding the offender's level of planning and control.
Psychological Evaluation:

Profilers consider psychological factors such as personality disorders, mental illnesses, and potential motives.
They may consult with forensic psychologists or psychiatrists to gain a deeper understanding of the offender's mental state.
Database and Historical Analysis:

Profilers may use databases and historical records to identify similar cases or offenders with similar profiles.
Comparing current cases with past ones can help predict future behavior.
Interviews and Surveys:

Profilers may conduct interviews with witnesses, victims, or those who knew the offender to gather additional information.
Behavioral surveys and questionnaires may be used to understand the offender's mindset.
It's important to note that psychological profiling is not foolproof, and there are limitations and controversies associated with its use. Profilers should work collaboratively with other investigative techniques, and their findings should be considered as one tool among many in the investigative process. Additionally, ethical considerations must be taken into account when applying psychological profiling techniques to ensure that individual rights and due process are respected.

Serial Killers [Part1] Serial Murderers Investigation [Serial Murderer]

The FBI commonly uses the term "serial murder" to describe a series of two or more murders committed as separate events, usually by one offender acting alone. To provide more clarity, the FBI has often referred to the following key elements in defining serial murder:

Multiple Victims: Serial murder involves the killing of two or more victims. These incidents typically occur over a period of time, with a cooling-off period between each event.

Distinctive Characteristics: Each murder, while part of a series, usually exhibits certain common characteristics that link the crimes. These may include similar methods, motives, or victim profiles.

Offender's Motivation: Serial murderers often have a psychological motive or gratification derived from the act of killing. Motivations can vary widely, ranging from thrill-seeking to power and control.

Pattern of Behavior: There is often a discernible pattern or consistency in the offender's behavior across multiple incidents. This pattern may manifest in the choice of victims, the method of killing, or other aspects of the crime.

It's important to note that the definition of serial killing may vary across jurisdictions, and different agencies or researchers might use slightly different criteria. The FBI's definition captures the essence of serial murder as a series of connected, intentional homicides committed by an individual over time, with distinct characteristics that link the crimes.

Serial killers exhibit a wide range of personalities, and it's important to note that not all individuals with these characteristics become criminals. The field of criminology and psychology has identified certain personality traits and disorders that may be associated with some serial killers. It's crucial to approach this topic with the understanding that individual cases can vary, and not all serial killers fit neatly into specific categories. Some commonly observed personality traits and disorders in serial killers include:

Psychopathy:

Many serial killers are diagnosed or characterized as psychopathic. Psychopathy involves traits such as a lack of empathy, remorse, and guilt, as well as manipulative behavior and a superficial charm.
Narcissistic Personality Disorder:

Some serial killers exhibit traits of narcissistic personality disorder, characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a lack of empathy, and a constant need for admiration.
Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD):

ASPD is a personality disorder characterized by a disregard for the rights of others, impulsivity, deceitfulness, and a lack of remorse after harming others. Many serial killers meet the criteria for ASPD.
Sadism:

Sadistic tendencies involve deriving pleasure or gratification from causing pain, suffering, or humiliation to others. This trait may be present in some serial killers, particularly those who engage in acts of torture.
Borderline Personality Disorder:

Some serial killers may display symptoms of borderline personality disorder, which can include instability in relationships, self-image, and emotions. Impulsivity and intense fear of abandonment are also common features.
Paranoia:

Paranoid tendencies may be present in some serial killers, leading to a pervasive distrust of others and a belief that they are constantly under threat.
Schizoid Personality Traits:

Schizoid personality traits involve detachment from social relationships, a limited range of emotional expression, and a preference for solitary activities. Some serial killers exhibit schizoid traits.
Childhood Trauma and Abuse:

Many serial killers have a history of childhood trauma, abuse, or neglect. Adverse childhood experiences can contribute to the development of psychopathology and violent tendencies.
Sexual Deviance:

Some serial killers exhibit sexual deviance, involving abnormal or harmful sexual behaviors. This can be a motivator for their crimes.
Compartmentalization:

Serial killers often display the ability to compartmentalize their lives, maintaining a seemingly normal exterior while engaging in violent criminal activities.
It's essential to approach the study of serial killers with sensitivity, recognizing that mental health and personality disorders alone do not explain criminal behavior. The interaction of various factors, including genetics, environment, and individual experiences, contributes to the complex phenomenon of serial killing.

IQ Assessment 2024 [Intellectual Disability Assessment 2024] Gazette Notification 

Intellectual Disability
Intellectual disability (ID), also known as intellectual developmental disorder, is characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. This condition manifests before the age of 18 and affects cognitive abilities such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptive skills, which include social, conceptual, and practical skills.

Diagnostic Criteria
The diagnostic criteria for ID as outlined in the DSM-5 include:

Deficits in Intellectual Functions: These include reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. These deficits are confirmed by both clinical assessment and standardized intelligence testing.

Deficits in Adaptive Functioning: These impair the individual‚Äôs ability to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living.

Onset During the Developmental Period: The intellectual and adaptive deficits must have been evident during the developmental period (typically before age 18).

Assessment of Intellectual Disability
Assessment of intellectual disability involves a comprehensive evaluation using both standardized intelligence tests and adaptive behavior measures.

Vineland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS)
The Vineland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS) is one of the most widely used tools for assessing adaptive behavior in individuals with ID. It was developed by Edgar A. Doll in 1935 and has undergone several revisions. The VSMS measures social competence across various domains and provides a comprehensive assessment of an individual's ability to adapt to and manage personal and social demands.

Domains Assessed by VSMS

Communication: This includes receptive, expressive, and written language skills.

Daily Living Skills: This includes personal care, domestic skills, and community functioning.

Socialization: This encompasses interpersonal relationships, play and leisure time, and coping skills.

Motor Skills: This includes both gross and fine motor abilities (primarily assessed in younger children).

Maladaptive Behavior: Optional domain that includes internalizing, externalizing, and other behaviors that may interfere with adaptive functioning.

Administration and Scoring

The VSMS is typically administered through a structured interview with a caregiver or through direct observation of the individual. The assessment yields a Social Quotient (SQ), which is analogous to the Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The SQ is calculated as follows:

Social¬†Age¬†(SA)/Chronological¬†Age¬†(CA) X 100

Social Age (SA): Represents the age level at which the individual is performing in terms of social maturity.

Chronological Age (CA): The actual age of the individual.
Interpretation

The results from the VSMS provide insights into the individual's strengths and weaknesses across different domains of adaptive behavior. This information is crucial for developing individualized intervention plans, educational programming, and support services. The assessment helps in identifying specific areas where the individual may need additional support or training to improve their adaptive functioning.

Summary
Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations in intellectual and adaptive functioning with onset during the developmental period. The Vineland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS) is a key tool for assessing adaptive behavior in individuals with ID. It measures social competence across domains like communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills, providing valuable insights for individualized intervention and support planning

Pharmacokinetics is the study of how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. Understanding these processes is crucial for optimizing the therapeutic effect and minimizing adverse effects of any medication, including RLAI.

Absorption: RLAI is administered as a deep intramuscular injection. After injection, risperidone microspheres are released gradually into the bloodstream. These microspheres ensure an extended and consistent release of the active drug, eliminating the need for daily dosing. The absorption phase is slow and sustained, leading to a controlled release of the drug.

Distribution: Risperidone has high plasma protein binding, primarily to albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. This binding influences the distribution of the drug throughout the body, impacting its availability to target sites in the brain and peripheral tissues. The long-acting nature of RLAI helps maintain steady-state concentrations, preventing wide fluctuations.

Metabolism: Risperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The primary active metabolite is 9-hydroxyrisperidone (paliperidone), which also has antipsychotic properties. The metabolism of risperidone, and the subsequent formation of paliperidone, contributes to the overall efficacy and safety profile of RLAI.

Excretion: Both risperidone and paliperidone are eliminated via renal excretion, primarily as conjugated metabolites. Dosing adjustments are necessary for patients with compromised renal function as they may require lower doses to prevent accumulation and potential adverse effects.

Dosage and Dosing Regimens

RLAI is available in various strengths and dosing intervals, offering flexibility for tailoring treatment to the patient's condition.

Initial Dosing: When initiating RLAI treatment, it is essential to establish the patient's response to oral risperidone. Typically, patients are initiated on oral risperidone (e.g., 1 to 2 mg per day) for several days to evaluate their tolerance and response.

Dosing Strengths: RLAI is available in several dosing strengths, including 25 mg, 37.5 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg. The selection of a specific strength is determined by the patient's clinical status, previous antipsychotic therapy, and the judgment of the treating physician.

Dosing Frequency: RLAI is administered every two weeks. The frequency is chosen based on the patient's response and tolerance to the medication. Patients who require higher doses or are transitioning from other antipsychotics may be started on a more frequent dosing regimen.

Initiating Risperidone Long-Acting Injectable Treatment

Oral Stabilization: Patients are initially started on oral risperidone to assess their response to the medication. This phase allows clinicians to determine the appropriate dose, monitor side effects, and ensure the medication is well-tolerated.

Advocates and Consumer Protection Act 2019; Implications on Medical Profession 

Bar of Indian Lawyers through its President Jasbir Singh Malik vs D.K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases 2024

Supreme Court Judgement 

The case of "Bar of Indian Lawyers through its President Jasbir Singh Malik vs. D.K. Gandhi PS National Institute of Communicable Diseases 2024" revolves around whether legal services provided by advocates fall under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act (CP Act) of 1986, re-enacted in 2019. The primary issue is whether a complaint alleging deficiency in service against advocates can be maintainable under the CP Act.

Context and Arguments
Background:

Factual Matrix: D.K. Gandhi, the respondent, hired advocate D.K. Gandhi to file a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The dispute arose when the advocate allegedly failed to deliver a cheque to the respondent and instead demanded cash, leading the respondent to file a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum seeking compensation for mental agony and harassment.

Legal Proceedings: The District Forum ruled in favor of the respondent, but the State Commission overturned this decision, stating that legal services do not fall within the ambit of "service" under the CP Act. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) later reversed the State Commission's decision, prompting appeals to the Supreme Court.

Arguments by Advocates:

For the Appellants:

Unique Nature of Legal Profession: The legal profession is sui generis (unique) and cannot be equated with other professions. It is a noble profession with duties towards the court, the client, and society.
Autonomy and Regulation: The Advocates Act, 1961, and the Bar Councils provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, including disciplinary mechanisms, making the profession self-regulated.

Contract of Personal Service: Services rendered by advocates are under a "contract of personal service," excluding them from the definition of "service" under the CP Act. Advocates act as agents of their clients and owe fiduciary duties, which include respecting the client's autonomy and acting within the scope of authority granted by the client.

Risk of Unnecessary Litigation: Including advocates under the CP Act would lead to a surge in frivolous complaints, burdening the legal system and potentially compromising the independence of the Bar.

Against the Appellants:

Consumer Protection Scope: The respondent argued that the CP Act's broad definition of "service" should include legal services, ensuring clients can seek redress for negligence or deficiency in services provided by advocates.

Public Interest: Allowing complaints against advocates under the CP Act would uphold consumer rights and ensure accountability within the legal profession.

Court's Analysis and Judgment

Intention of the Legislature: The Court concluded that the legislature did not intend to include professions like law within the CP Act, which aims to protect consumers from unfair trade practices and unethical business practices, typically associated with commercial transactions.

Sui Generis Nature of Legal Profession: The Court emphasized the unique role of advocates, their duties to the court, and the regulatory framework under the Advocates Act, which provides mechanisms for addressing professional misconduct.

Contract of Personal Service: The services provided by advocates are categorized under a "contract of personal service," thereby excluding them from the CP Act's definition of "service."

The Supreme Court set aside the NCDRC's decision, ruling that complaints alleging deficiency in service against advocates are not maintainable under the CP Act, reinforcing the distinct and regulated nature of the legal profession .

Extended Half-Life: Haloperidol Decanoate possesses an extended half-life, typically ranging from 21 to 28 days. This prolonged half-life contributes to the medication's sustained therapeutic action, reducing the frequency of administration required.

Mechanism of Action: Haloperidol, the active component released from Haloperidol Decanoate, exerts its antipsychotic effects primarily by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. This mechanism helps alleviate positive symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions.

Administration and Frequency

Haloperidol Decanoate is administered through intramuscular injection, commonly into the gluteal muscle. The frequency of administration is determined by the patient's clinical requirements, their response to treatment, and the specific indication. Typical dosing schedules for Haloperidol Decanoate include:

Initial Loading Dose: An initial loading dose is often administered to quickly establish a therapeutic level of the medication. The loading dose typically ranges from 10 to 20 times the patient's daily oral dose of Haloperidol. The specific dose may vary based on the patient's clinical condition and previous antipsychotic exposure.

Maintenance Dosing: Following the loading dose, maintenance injections are given at regular intervals. These intervals may range from every four weeks to every six weeks. The choice of dosing frequency is based on the patient's clinical response, side effect profile, and the clinical judgment of the treating physician.

Response Assessment: Continuous monitoring of the patient's clinical response and side effects is crucial. Adjustments to the dosing regimen can be made to optimize the therapeutic effect while minimizing side effects. The flexibility in dosing frequency is a significant advantage of long-acting antipsychotic medications like Haloperidol Decanoate.

Dosing and Titration

Determining the appropriate dosage of Haloperidol Decanoate involves careful consideration of various factors:

Symptom Severity: Patients with severe or acute psychotic symptoms may require a higher initial loading dose to achieve a rapid therapeutic effect. After achieving symptom control, the maintenance dose can be adjusted as needed.

Individual Response: Patient-specific factors, including metabolism, drug sensitivity, and the presence of comorbid conditions, can influence the optimal dosage. Some individuals may respond well to lower doses, while others may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic benefit.

Weight and Body Mass: A patient's weight and body mass can influence the appropriate dosage. In some cases, higher body mass may necessitate a slightly higher dose to maintain therapeutic plasma levels.


Long-acting Haloperidol Decanoate is a valuable tool in the management of psychotic disorders, providing extended therapeutic effects and addressing issues associated with medication adherence. Its pharmacological properties, including the gradual and steady release of the active compound Haloperidol, contribute to its clinical efficacy. The dosing frequency can be tailored to the individual patient's specific clinical needs, allowing for flexibility and personalization of treatment.

The individualized dosing, ease of administration, and potential for improved adherence make Haloperidol Decanoate an attractive choice in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Careful assessment and regular monitoring of the patient's clinical response and side effect profile are crucial to optimize treatment outcomes. While it is not without potential side effects, the advantages of Haloperidol Decanoate in terms of extended therapeutic effect and reduced reliance on daily medication regimens make it a valuable addition to contemporary psychiatric practice.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics [Depot Antipsychotics] Injectable Antipsychotics    

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIAs) have emerged as a valuable treatment option for individuals with severe mental illnesses, particularly schizophrenia. This vidoe provides an overview of LAIAs, focusing on their efficacy, advantages, and potential future directions

Schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses pose a significant challenge in the field of psychiatry. Managing the symptoms of these conditions and preventing relapses are critical to enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIAs) have gained prominence as an effective treatment strategy for these patients. LAIAs are a form of medication delivery that provides sustained release of antipsychotic agents over extended periods, typically ranging from two weeks to several months. This paper explores the efficacy and advantages of LAIAs in managing severe mental illnesses while addressing potential future directions for research and development.

Efficacy of LAIAs:

Improved Medication Adherence:
One of the primary advantages of LAIAs is their ability to address the issue of medication non-adherence. Patients with schizophrenia often struggle to adhere to their oral medication regimens, leading to treatment discontinuation and increased risk of relapse. LAIAs eliminate the need for daily dosing, improving overall adherence rates and enhancing treatment outcomes. Multiple studies have demonstrated that LAIAs are associated with reduced hospitalizations and relapses compared to oral antipsychotic medications.

Reduced Relapse Rates:
The sustained release of antipsychotic agents provided by LAIAs contributes to a more stable therapeutic drug concentration in the body. This stable concentration reduces the risk of breakthrough symptoms, leading to a lower rate of relapse among individuals with schizophrenia. Research indicates that LAIAs are particularly effective in preventing symptom exacerbation, enhancing the long-term management of the condition.

Better Symptom Control:
LAIAs have been shown to provide better symptom control, leading to improved quality of life for patients. They offer a consistent and prolonged therapeutic effect, reducing the fluctuations in drug levels that can occur with oral medications. This stable drug concentration helps control positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive impairments associated with severe mental illnesses.

Advantages of LAIAs:

Individualized Treatment:
LAIAs can be tailored to individual patient needs, allowing for personalized treatment plans. The choice of LAIA and dosing interval can be adjusted based on factors such as the patient's response, side effects, and lifestyle, providing flexibility in treatment management.

Caregiver and Family Involvement:
LAIAs can facilitate family and caregiver involvement in the treatment process. With the need for less frequent administration, family members and healthcare providers can collaborate more effectively in monitoring the patient's progress and ensuring treatment adherence.

Challenges and Future Directions:

Patient Acceptance:
Despite their advantages, LAIAs face some resistance from patients who may be uncomfortable with injections or prefer the autonomy of oral medications. Addressing this challenge involves educating patients about the benefits of LAIAs and involving them in shared decision-making regarding their treatment plan.

Dosing Strategies:
Optimizing dosing intervals and administration schedules for LAIAs is an ongoing area of research. Individualizing treatment regimens and improving patient outcomes are dependent on refining these dosing strategies.

Novel Formulations and Mechanisms:
Developing new LAIA formulations and mechanisms of delivery is a promising avenue for future research. Novel approaches could enhance the duration of effect and improve the tolerability of LAIAs.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics offer a valuable option for the management of severe mental illnesses, particularly schizophrenia. Their demonstrated efficacy in improving medication adherence, reducing relapse rates, and providing better symptom control make them a crucial tool in the field of psychiatry. However, challenges related to patient acceptance and dosing strategies must be addressed to further advance the use of LAIAs. Future research and development should focus on individualized treatment regimens, reducing stigma, and exploring novel formulations to optimize the benefits of LAIAs in the management of severe mental illnesses. The continued development and refinement of LAIAs hold promise for improving the lives of individuals living with these challenging conditions

Clozapine Resistant Schizophrenia [Part 4] Ultra Resistance Schizophrenia [Refractory Schizophrenia]

Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the global population. It is characterized by a diverse range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms, often leading to significant functional impairment. While a substantial proportion of individuals with schizophrenia benefit from conventional antipsychotic treatments, a subgroup, referred to as Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS), does not respond adequately to these medications. Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is often considered the last resort for managing TRS. However, even clozapine may prove ineffective for some patients, leading to the classification of Clozapine-Resistant Schizophrenia (CRS).

In this video, I provide a comprehensive overview of CRS

Clinical Aspects of Clozapine-Resistant Schizophrenia
Diagnostic Criteria
Clozapine-Resistant Schizophrenia (CRS) is a subtype of TRS, and its diagnosis is primarily clinical. To be classified as having CRS, a patient must meet the following criteria:

Failure of Adequate Clozapine Trial: The patient must have undergone an adequate trial of clozapine, typically at a therapeutic dose (usually 300-450 mg/day) for at least 12 weeks.

Persistence of Severe Symptoms: Despite the clozapine trial, the patient continues to experience prominent and debilitating positive and/or negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Exclusion of Non-Response Causes: Other factors contributing to non-response, such as non-adherence, substance abuse, or medical conditions, must be carefully excluded.

Confirmatory Assessments: The diagnosis may be confirmed by additional clinical assessments, such as clinician-rated and patient-reported outcomes.

Combination Therapies
One approach involves combining clozapine with other antipsychotic medications, such as aripiprazole, olanzapine, or amisulpride. This combination therapy, known as polypharmacy, is often considered when clozapine monotherapy proves ineffective. However, the safety and efficacy of these combinations require careful consideration, as interactions between antipsychotic drugs can lead to adverse effects.

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used in cases of severe TRS, including CRS. ECT is typically considered when other treatments have failed. While ECT can lead to significant improvements in symptoms, its use is associated with cognitive side effects, and the benefits must be carefully weighed against the risks.

Conclusion
Clozapine-Resistant Schizophrenia presents a significant challenge in the management of this debilitating mental disorder. While clozapine is often regarded as the gold standard for TRS, a subset of patients with CRS does not respond adequately to this medication. Understanding the clinical characteristics and potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying CRS is essential for developing alternative treatment strategies and improving the lives of individuals facing this complex condition.

While current treatment options for CRS are limited, ongoing research into the neurobiology of CRS and the development of novel treatment approaches offer hope for better outcomes for these patients. It is essential to continue the pursuit of innovative therapies and personalized treatment strategies to address the unique needs of individuals with Clozapine-Resistant Schizophrenia and ultimately improve their quality of life.

Treatment Resistant Schizophrenia [Part 3] Neurobiology

Neurobiology of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by disturbances in thinking, perception, and emotional regulation. While many patients with schizophrenia respond well to antipsychotic medications, a subgroup experiences treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), which is defined by a lack of response to conventional treatments. This video explores the neurobiological underpinnings of TRS, focusing on genetic, neuroimaging, and neurotransmitter-related factors. Understanding the neurobiology of TRS is crucial for developing more effective treatments and improving the lives of individuals who struggle with this challenging condition.

TRS represents a significant clinical challenge, as it leads to persistent distress and functional impairment for affected individuals. In this article, we delve into the neurobiology of TRS, examining the genetic, neuroimaging, and neurotransmitter-related factors that contribute to its development and persistence.

Genetic Factors

Heritability of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia has a well-established genetic component. Family, twin, and adoption studies have consistently demonstrated that the risk of developing schizophrenia is higher in individuals with affected relatives. The heritability of schizophrenia is estimated to be around 80%, indicating that genetic factors play a substantial role in its etiology.

Genetic Risk in TRS
Recent research has aimed to identify specific genetic factors associated with TRS. Several studies have suggested that TRS may have a stronger genetic component than non-resistant forms of schizophrenia. One of the genes that have received considerable attention in TRS research is COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase). Polymorphisms in the COMT gene are associated with differences in dopamine transmission and have been implicated in the cognitive and clinical profiles of TRS patients.

Epigenetic Mechanisms
In addition to genetic factors, epigenetic modifications have gained attention in TRS research. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes have been linked to the regulation of genes involved in neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, and synaptic plasticity, all of which are relevant to schizophrenia and potentially TRS.

Neuroimaging Findings
Neuroimaging techniques have provided valuable insights into the neurobiology of TRS. Several key findings in this area shed light on the structural and functional brain abnormalities associated with the disorder.

Structural Abnormalities
MRI studies have consistently revealed structural abnormalities in TRS patients. Some of the most prominent findings include:

Enlarged Ventricles: TRS patients often exhibit enlarged lateral and third ventricles, indicative of brain atrophy. This is associated with cognitive impairments and may reflect neurodegenerative processes.

Reduced Gray Matter Volume: Studies have reported reduced gray matter volume in various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. These reductions are associated with cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in TRS patients.

Functional Abnormalities
Functional neuroimaging studies, such as fMRI and PET scans, have provided insights into the abnormal activation patterns in TRS patients:

Hypofrontality: Reduced prefrontal cortex activity is a consistent finding in TRS patients. This hypofrontality is linked to cognitive impairments and deficits in executive function.

The Role of Inflammation
Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation may play a role in TRS. Inflammation in the central nervous system can lead to neuronal damage and synaptic dysfunction, contributing to the severity and treatment resistance of schizophrenia.

Microglial Activation: Post-mortem studies have reported signs of microglial activation, indicating an inflammatory response in the brains of TRS patients.

Cytokine Dysregulation: Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines have been found in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of TRS patients. These cytokines can impact neurotransmitter systems and contribute to neurodegenerative processes.

Conclusion
Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia is a complex and challenging condition, often refractory to conventional antipsychotic medications. The neurobiology of TRS is multifaceted, involving genetic, neuroimaging, neurotransmitter-related, and inflammatory factors. Understanding the intricate interplay between these factors is crucial for developing more effective treatments that target the specific mechanisms underlying TRS.

Management of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia [Part 2] Assessment & Treatment 

Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS) poses a significant challenge in psychiatric care, as it represents a subset of individuals who do not respond adequately to conventional antipsychotic treatments. This video explores the multifaceted evidence-based approach to managing TRS, encompassing pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.

Gold Standard Treatment 

Clozapine is the most extensively studied and effective medication for TRS. It is classified as an atypical antipsychotic and is often considered the "gold standard" for managing TRS (Remington et al., 2017). Clozapine's unique pharmacological profile, which includes serotonergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic receptor modulation, sets it apart from other antipsychotic medications. Its effectiveness in TRS is well-established, with studies showing a substantial reduction in positive and negative symptoms (Howes et al., 2017).

While clozapine is highly effective, its use is associated with significant challenges. Patients prescribed clozapine require regular blood monitoring to manage the risk of agranulocytosis, which can be life-threatening. Additionally, it may cause metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and diabetes, which necessitate close monitoring and interventions (Fleischhacker et al., 2019). The stringent monitoring requirements can be a barrier to its wider use.

For individuals who do not respond adequately to clozapine, augmentation strategies are often considered. These involve adding other 

- medications, such as antipsychotics or mood stabilizers, to enhance the therapeutic effect. 
- ECT
- rTMS
- Newer Antipsychotics 

Augmentation with antipsychotics aims to enhance the blockade of dopaminergic D2 receptors, a primary target in antipsychotic treatment. These combinations may improve positive and negative symptom control. However, the evidence supporting the efficacy of augmentation strategies is limited and controversial. Not all individuals with TRS benefit from this approach, and the risks of increased side effects should be carefully weighed against potential benefits (Meltzer et al., 2011).

In some cases, mood stabilizers, such as lithium or valproate, are considered as augmentation agents. These medications are believed to have neuroprotective and mood-stabilizing effects that can complement antipsychotic treatment. However, evidence supporting this approach is mixed, and the choice of augmentation agent should be guided by an individual's clinical profile (Zoccali et al., 2018). 

However, the evidence supporting the efficacy of augmentation strategies is limited, and clinicians must weigh the potential benefits against the risk of adverse effects (Meltzer et al., 2011).

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing positive and negative symptoms in patients with TRS. CBT focuses on identifying and modifying cognitive distortions and negative thought patterns. It can also help patients manage distressing symptoms and improve coping skills (Wykes et al., 2008).

Involving families in the treatment of individuals with TRS is vital. Family interventions aim to reduce stress within the family and improve communication, problem-solving, and coping skills. These interventions have shown promise in reducing relapse rates and improving patient outcomes (Pitschel-Walz et al., 2015).

Several second-generation antipsychotics have emerged as potential alternatives for managing TRS. These include lurasidone, brexpiprazole, and cariprazine. These medications have unique pharmacological profiles and may offer better tolerability and safety profiles compared to first-generation antipsychotics (Citrome, 2016).

Emerging research has highlighted the role of the glutamatergic system in schizophrenia. Glutamatergic modulators, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (e.g., memantine) and glycine receptor agonists (e.g., D-serine), have shown promise in improving TRS symptoms. These agents aim to enhance glutamate neurotransmission, which is thought to be disrupted in schizophrenia (Schell et al., 2013).

In conclusion, the pharmacological management of Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia is an ongoing area of research and clinical innovation. The use of personalized treatment plans, considering the individual's symptom severity, previous treatment response, and potential risks, is essential in optimizing outcomes for individuals with TRS. While challenges remain, the evolving landscape of TRS management offers hope for improved symptom control and a better quality of life for those affected by this condition.

Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia [Part 1] Definitions, Prevalence and Predictors of TRS 

Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental disorder that affects individuals across the globe, leading to significant social and functional impairments. While antipsychotic medications have proven effective for many patients, there exists a subset that does not respond adequately to treatment, referred to as Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS). TRS poses significant challenges for both clinicians and patients, as it is associated with prolonged suffering, decreased quality of life, and a higher burden on healthcare systems. In this essay, we will explore the definitions, prevalence, and predictors of TRS in an effort to better understand this condition and its implications for those who suffer from it. This video explores the definitions, prevalence, and predictors of TRS 

Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS) refers to a subset of individuals with schizophrenia who do not achieve a satisfactory response to conventional antipsychotic medications. Although there is no universally accepted definition of TRS, it is often described as a lack of significant symptom reduction despite treatment with two or more antipsychotic agents, at adequate dosages, and for a sufficient duration (Howes et al., 2017). The lack of consensus on TRS criteria has led to variations in its prevalence estimates and clinical management.

Estimating the prevalence of TRS is a challenging task due to the lack of a universally accepted definition and the variability in clinical practice across different regions. Various studies have reported prevalence rates ranging from 70% to 60% of all individuals with schizophrenia. 

Patients with an earlier onset of schizophrenia and a longer duration of untreated psychosis are at an increased risk of developing TRS. This underscores the importance of early intervention in the course of the illness, as prompt treatment may prevent the development of refractory symptoms (Wimberley et al., 2016). 

Substance use, particularly cannabis, has been linked to the development of TRS. Cannabis use can exacerbate psychotic symptoms and interfere with the efficacy of antipsychotic medications. Addressing substance use issues is crucial in managing TRS (Di Forti et al., 2019).

Non-adherence to antipsychotic medications is a significant predictor of TRS. Many patients with schizophrenia struggle with medication adherence due to side effects, stigma, or lack of insight into their illness. Effective strategies to improve adherence are essential in preventing treatment resistance (Velligan et al., 2017).

Stress and traumatic life events have been associated with the worsening of psychotic symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. Strategies for managing stress and addressing trauma may play a role in reducing the risk of TRS (Trotta et al., 2019).

Schizophrenia is a complex and debilitating mental disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. A subset of these patients, classified as having Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia (TRS), does not respond adequately to conventional antipsychotic treatments.

Borderline Personality Disorder [Borderline PD] Borderline Personality 

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition characterized by intense and unstable emotions, impulsive behaviors, a distorted self-image, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Here are some common features associated with borderline personality disorder:

1. Intense and unstable emotions: Individuals with BPD often experience intense and rapidly shifting emotions. They may frequently feel sadness, anger, anxiety, or emptiness. These emotional fluctuations can be triggered by minor events and may last for extended periods.

2. Unstable self-image: People with BPD may have an unclear sense of self and struggle with a shifting self-image. They may experience feelings of emptiness and a chronic sense of inner void, leading to a reliance on external factors for a sense of identity.

3. Impulsive behaviors: Individuals with BPD often engage in impulsive behaviors without considering the potential consequences. This can include reckless spending, substance abuse, self-harm, binge eating, or engaging in unsafe sexual practices.

4. Unstable and intense relationships: They tend to have unstable and tumultuous relationships marked by idealization and devaluation. Individuals with BPD may idolize others initially, only to quickly switch to devaluing them when they perceive rejection or abandonment.

5. Fear of abandonment: People with BPD often have an intense fear of abandonment, which can lead to clingy or controlling behaviors in relationships. They may go to great lengths to avoid real or imagined abandonment, even resorting to self-destructive actions.

6. Chronic feelings of emptiness: Individuals with BPD may frequently experience a persistent sense of emptiness or a lack of fulfillment. They may struggle to find meaning or purpose in life.

7. Self-destructive behaviors and self-harm: Some individuals with BPD engage in self-destructive behaviors as a way to cope with emotional pain or regain a sense of control. Self-harm, such as cutting or burning, may be used as a means of emotional regulation.

Treatment for borderline personality disorder typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and support from a mental health professional. Here are some common treatment approaches:

1. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): DBT is a type of therapy specifically designed for individuals with BPD. It focuses on developing skills for emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness.

2. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT can help individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and develop healthier coping strategies. It may be used to address specific symptoms, such as impulsive behaviors or self-harm.

3. Medication: While there are no specific medications for BPD itself, medications such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, or antianxiety medications may be prescribed to address accompanying symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, or impulsivity.

4. Supportive therapy: Providing a supportive and validating therapeutic environment can help individuals with BPD build trust, feel understood, and develop healthier relationships.

5. Group therapy: Participating in group therapy with others who have BPD can provide a sense of belonging, validation, and an opportunity to learn from shared experiences.

It's important to note that treatment for BPD can be complex and long-term. It requires a collaborative and individualized approach tailored to the specific needs of the individual. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of BPD, it is recommended to seek help from a mental health professional who specializes in the treatment of personality disorders.

Sale of Medicine by Doctors [Dispensing of Medicines by Doctors in their Clinics]

In India, manufacturing, storing, transportation, distribution, and dispensing of drugs are licensed and regulated under the drugs and cosmetic act, 1940; Indian Medical Council Act, 1956; the Pharmacy Act, 1948; and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Prescribing and dispensing medicines at the same time to their patients by registered medical practitioners (RMPs) is a well-known practice in all systems of medicine across the country. Further, the kind of branded medicines a patient gets from the clinics will come wrapped in a huge profit margin for RMPs, and this has been an alternative source of income to them. 

Dispensing and selling of medicines by RMPs at their clinics to their patients may represent a significant potential conflict of interest with the medical ethical principles, namely autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence and it raises various ethical and legal challenges. This videos focuses on the ethical and legal issues of this practice and emphasizes the need for a proactive and dynamic approach to meet the rising demand for quality healthcare in India.

The World Health Organization describes ‚ÄúDispensing‚Äù as a process of preparing and giving medicine to a named person on the basis of a prescription from a registered practitioner. However, it is not uncommon to see the registered medical practitioners (RMPs) performing both the dual role of prescribing and dispensing medicine. This dual role of prescribing and dispensing of medication is common in all system of practice. This also includes home visits done by (RMPs), when medicines are carried in a doctor's bag to dispense to their patients. Although this practice is decreasing in major cities, it continues to be prevalent in semi-urban and rural areas. A recent trend noted in metropolitan cities is that many RMPs are doing home visits to treat patients, especially in disabled and geriatric services. Initially, this provision was intended to address the needs of communities where there were no pharmacists. This practice of dispensing of medicine by RMPs was allowed so that consultation, prescription, treatment-related materials, and medicines are available inside the clinic so that a patient does not have to run to the pharmacy to get medicines that have been prescribed

RMPs selling medicines at their clinics to their patients may represent a significant potential conflict of interest against the medical ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. 

The Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics for RMPs and it is titled ‚ÄúIndian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 (Amended on 2016).‚Äù In the above regulations, section 6.3 clearly states that an RMPs should not run an open shop for sale of medicine for dispensing prescriptions prescribed by RMPs other than himself or for sale of medical or surgical appliances. It is not unethical for RMPs to prescribe or supply drugs, remedies or appliances as long as there is no exploitation of the patient. Drugs prescribed by an RMPs for a patient should explicitly state the proprietary formulae as well as the generic name of the drug. 

The challenges faced in the healthcare system cannot be viewed in isolation. A thorough evaluation indicates that corruption, in general, has pervaded the very fabric of society and is reflected in the medical profession also. Other major contributors are the commercialization of the medical education, gradual deterioration of the public health system, and poor political will to address this issue. The opportunities are as follows: investing in health, abolishing medical education based on the capitation fee, enhancing the rural population's access to quality health care, leveraging innovative technologies such as telemedicine to provide clinical care, improving the basic health infrastructure in rural areas, controlling corruption in the health sector, stopping the supply of substandard equipment and medications, encouraging online pharmacy, and stricter law

To conclude, doctor‚Äìpatient relationships are of trust and confidence, where the fiduciary must act in the interests of the beneficiary and stop this in-house pharmacy phenomenon. There are many medicines where the price varies across brands because they are not under price control. The price of the nonessential drugs has been left to the greed of the market. The cost of medicines makes treatment less affordable for most of the population. To curtail the nonuniform cost across the company, there is a need for strong political will to enforce ‚Äúone medicine, one price‚Äù across all brands. E-pharmacy is a new avenue may have the potential to alter the existing in-house pharmacy practice of making a huge profit margin from patients.

Narcissistic Personality disorder [Narcissistic PD]

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Grandiose sense of self-importance: They have an exaggerated sense of their own abilities, achievements, and importance. They may believe they are superior to others and expect to be recognized as such.

2. Constant need for admiration: People with NPD have a strong need for attention, praise, and admiration from others. They may seek constant validation and admiration to maintain their self-esteem.

3. Lack of empathy: They often have difficulty recognizing or understanding the feelings and needs of others. They may disregard or minimize the experiences of others, and their behavior is typically self-centered and self-focused.

4. Sense of entitlement: Individuals with NPD may believe they deserve special treatment, privileges, or attention. They may expect others to comply with their wishes without question and may become angry or frustrated if their demands are not met.

5. Exploitative behavior: They may exploit or take advantage of others to meet their own needs and desires. They may lack empathy for the impact of their behavior on others and disregard the boundaries and feelings of those around them.

6. Envious and arrogant attitudes: People with NPD may harbor feelings of envy towards others and believe that others are envious of them. They may display arrogant behaviors and attitudes, belittling or demeaning those they perceive as inferior.

7. Fragile self-esteem: Underneath the grandiose facade, individuals with NPD may have fragile self-esteem and are highly sensitive to criticism or perceived slights. They may react with anger, defensiveness, or a sense of humiliation when their self-image is challenged.

It's important to note that individuals with narcissistic personality disorder often have difficulty seeking treatment or recognizing the impact of their behavior on others. However, therapy, such as psychodynamic therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be beneficial in helping individuals with NPD develop healthier coping mechanisms, improve their interpersonal relationships, and address underlying emotional issues.

If you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, it is recommended to consult with a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.

Treating narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) can be challenging because individuals with NPD often have difficulty recognizing or acknowledging their own problematic behavior and may resist seeking treatment. However, therapy can still be beneficial in helping individuals with NPD develop healthier ways of relating to others and managing their self-esteem. Here are some approaches that may be used in the treatment of NPD:

1. Psychotherapy: Various forms of psychotherapy can be employed to address the underlying issues associated with NPD. Psychodynamic therapy aims to explore unconscious conflicts and early life experiences that contribute to narcissistic traits. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals with NPD identify and modify maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors. Group therapy or family therapy can also be useful in improving interpersonal relationships and addressing the impact of NPD on others.

2. Empathy and validation: Building a therapeutic alliance based on empathy and validation can help individuals with NPD feel understood and reduce their defensive barriers. This can involve acknowledging their experiences and emotions while also gently challenging their distortions or unhealthy behaviors.

3. Developing self-awareness: Encouraging individuals with NPD to develop self-awareness can be a crucial aspect of therapy. This involves helping them recognize the impact of their behavior on themselves and others, and fostering insight into the underlying insecurities and vulnerabilities that drive their grandiose self-image.

4. Addressing co-occurring conditions: Individuals with NPD may also experience other mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety. Treating these co-occurring conditions can improve overall well-being and facilitate engagement in therapy.

5. Boundary setting and interpersonal skills: Therapy can focus on helping individuals with NPD develop healthier interpersonal skills, including respecting boundaries, empathizing with others, and engaging in more cooperative and mutually satisfying relationships.

Digital Mental Health (Health Technology): Present and Future  

Deloitte currently projects the global spending on mobile mental health apps alone will amount to almost $500 million in 2022, up from less than $300 million in 2021. And we can anticipate the total market for software solutions for mental conditions will be even larger. The global market for mental health software was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020, and it's expected to reach $4.5 billion by 2026. There is a huge market for digital mental health. 

Digital tools are transforming mental health care. The promise of this transformation to improve outcomes has not yet been realized fully. Digital mental health refers to services targeting mental health problems via online and mobile technologies. Digital mental health enthusiast claim that by using modern technology we can prevent and provide treatment for anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions. 

The prevalence of mental illness varies from 10-20% across the globe. Treatment gap varies from 70 to 80% across the developing world. 
To address these treatment gaps, a range of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been developed over the past 25‚Äâyears. These interventions have been developed to offer an alternative to traditionally delivered mental health interventions, and may be more accessible and acceptable to some individuals. 

Digital intervention tools are already commonplace in the self-management of general mental health, and in the clinical care for people with both chronic physical and mental ill-health. This is not surprising given the ubiquitous permeation of digital technologies in most people‚Äôs lives in the developed world today. Policy makers have also recognised the need to leverage digital technologies in public health system for improving the health system.

Despite the possibility of effective, implementable digital tools, it is unwise to dismiss the potential risks of digital interventions. The concerns regarding privacy and confidentiality regarding digital media also extend to digital health interventions. 

Many are also concerned about the harmful impacts of digital technologies, especially among adolescents, and the risks of entrenching their screen use by offering digital modalities of care. This is not surprising given the increasing complexity of artificial intelligence systems driving commercial digital media. Given the emerging data on the risk of mental ill-health from the use of social media, it is vital to monitor risks for each patient and at a population level with further research. 

Reviews of mobile mental health apps have found that the majority of commercially available apps do not include a privacy policy or terms of agreement, the reading level of existing written policies is frequently inaccessible to the general population and many of the existing privacy policies state that users‚Äô information may be shared with third parties

Digital Mental Health that include human support are often more effective than self-guided or automated treatments. As the world continues to struggle with crises and accessibility, a number and variety of mental health tech solutions arises. This may just be the beginning of a new chapter in exciting new mental health tech solutions and challenges.

Neuropsychiatric aspects of Traumatic Brain Injury (Psychiatric disorders after head injury)

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can have significant neuropsychiatric consequences due to the complex interplay of physical, chemical, and structural changes in the brain. These neuropsychiatric aspects can vary widely depending on the severity, location, and type of injury. Here are some key neuropsychiatric aspects of TBI:

Cognitive Impairment: TBI often results in cognitive deficits, including problems with memory, attention, concentration, and executive functions like planning and decision-making. These deficits can be temporary or long-lasting, depending on the extent of the injury.

Mood Disorders:

Depression: TBI survivors are at an increased risk of developing depression, which can manifest as persistent sadness, changes in sleep and appetite, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities.
Anxiety: Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are common after TBI, especially in cases involving a traumatic event.
Emotional Dysregulation: TBI can lead to difficulties in regulating emotions, resulting in mood swings and irritability.
Psychosis: Some individuals with severe TBI may experience hallucinations, delusions, or other symptoms of psychosis. These symptoms are often related to damage to specific brain regions.

Behavioral Changes:

Aggression: TBI can lead to increased irritability and impulsivity, which may result in aggressive behavior.
Apathy: Some individuals with TBI may become apathetic, losing interest in previously important activities or experiencing reduced motivation.
Social Impairments: Difficulties in social interactions, such as impaired social judgment and inappropriate behavior, can occur.
Substance Abuse: TBI survivors may have an increased risk of substance abuse as a way to cope with emotional and cognitive challenges.

Sleep Disorders: TBI can disrupt sleep patterns, leading to difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restorative sleep. Sleep problems can exacerbate other neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Headaches and Pain: Chronic headaches and other forms of pain are common post-TBI and can contribute to mood disturbances and decreased quality of life.

Suicidal Ideation: Individuals with TBI, particularly those experiencing severe emotional and cognitive challenges, may be at a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

The management of neuropsychiatric disorders after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex and often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The specific treatment plan will depend on the nature and severity of the neuropsychiatric symptoms, but here are some general strategies and interventions commonly used in the management of these disorders:

Medication Management:

Psychiatric Medications: Depending on the specific neuropsychiatric symptoms, medications such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and sleep aids may be prescribed.
Pain Management: If pain is a contributing factor to neuropsychiatric symptoms, pain management strategies should be implemented.
Psychotherapy:

Individual and Family Therapy: Psychotherapy can be beneficial for both the individual with TBI and their family members to address the emotional and interpersonal challenges that often arise.

Cognitive Training: Cognitive rehabilitation programs can help improve memory, attention, and executive functioning through structured exercises and strategies.

Occupational Therapy: Occupational therapists can work on improving functional abilities and independence in daily activities.

Social Support and Education: Providing education and support to both the individual with TBI and their family can improve understanding and coping with the challenges associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Substance Abuse Treatment: If substance abuse issues develop after TBI, addiction treatment programs may be necessary.

Behavioral Interventions: Behavioral strategies, such as anger management and social skills training, can help individuals with TBI manage challenging behaviors.

Monitor for Co-occurring Conditions: Keep an eye out for co-occurring conditions such as seizures, which can develop after TBI and exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Regular Follow-Up and Reassessment: The treatment plan should be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed based on the individual's progress and changing needs.

It's important to note that the management of neuropsychiatric disorders after TBI is often a long-term process, and there may be ups and downs along the way. A supportive and understanding network of healthcare professionals, family, and friends is crucial in helping individuals with TBI achieve the best possible outcomes in terms of their neuropsychiatric well-being and overall quality of life.

Traumatic Brain Injury [Part 1]

A Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a complex medical condition that occurs when an external force causes damage to the brain. TBIs can range from mild to severe, and they are often classified into three categories:

Mild TBI (Concussion):

Mild TBIs are the most common type and are often referred to as concussions.
Symptoms may include headache, confusion, memory problems, dizziness, and temporary loss of consciousness.
Most people with mild TBIs recover fully with rest and time, although some may experience persistent symptoms, known as post-concussion syndrome.
Moderate TBI:

Moderate TBIs involve more significant brain damage and symptoms.
Symptoms may include prolonged loss of consciousness (from minutes to hours), memory problems, coordination difficulties, and changes in behavior.
Rehabilitation is often required to address the physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges associated with moderate TBIs.
Severe TBI:

Severe TBIs are the most serious and can result in long-lasting or permanent impairments.
Symptoms may include extended loss of consciousness (hours to days), severe cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and personality changes.
Individuals with severe TBIs typically require intensive medical and rehabilitative care.
Causes of Traumatic Brain Injuries:

TBIs can be caused by various incidents, including falls, car accidents, sports-related injuries, assaults, and combat-related injuries (such as those sustained by military personnel).
The specific effects of a TBI depend on factors like the force of the impact, the location of the injury, and the extent of damage to brain tissue.
Diagnosis and Treatment:

Diagnosing a TBI often involves medical evaluation, neurological exams, and imaging tests like CT scans or MRIs.
Treatment for TBIs may involve rest, medication for symptoms like pain or nausea, surgery to remove hematoma (blood clots), and rehabilitation therapies to address physical, cognitive, and emotional deficits.
The course of recovery can vary widely, with some individuals regaining full function, while others may have lifelong challenges.
Prevention:

TBIs are preventable to some extent by taking safety precautions such as wearing seat belts, using helmets during sports or motorcycling, and taking measures to prevent falls, especially among older adults.
Reducing the risk of violence and accidents in general can also help reduce the incidence of TBIs.
It's important to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect a TBI, as early intervention can improve outcomes and minimize complications. Rehabilitation and support from healthcare professionals are often crucial for individuals recovering from TBIs, regardless of their severity

Delusional Misidentification Syndrome [Capgras Syndrome] Fregoli Syndrome 

Delusional Misidentification Syndrome (DMS) is a group of rare psychiatric disorders characterized by a person's belief that someone or something familiar has been altered or replaced with an impostor or duplicate. DMS is often associated with other mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia or dementia, and can be quite challenging to diagnose and treat. 

There are several subtypes of DMS, including Capgras syndrome, Fregoli syndrome, and Intermetamorphosis. Let's explore the diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of DMS.

Diagnosis:
Diagnosing DMS typically involves a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation. The diagnostic criteria for DMS include:

Delusional Belief: The patient firmly believes that someone (usually a loved one) or something (objects, places, or even themselves) has been replaced or transformed into an impostor or look-alike.

Normal Reality Testing: Despite the delusional belief, the individual is otherwise well-oriented and does not exhibit gross impairments in their ability to perceive and interact with the world.

Distress or Impairment: The delusional belief causes significant distress to the individual or impairs their daily functioning.

Exclusion of Other Psychiatric Conditions: The symptoms of DMS should not be better explained by another mental health disorder, substance abuse, or a medical condition.

Etiology:
The exact cause of DMS is not well understood, but it is often associated with other underlying conditions, which may include:

Neurological Factors: Some cases of DMS have been linked to brain injuries, lesions, or dysfunction in specific brain regions, especially the frontal and temporal lobes.

Psychiatric Disorders: DMS frequently co-occurs with conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder.

Neurochemical Imbalances: Imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, are thought to contribute to the development of delusional disorders like DMS.

Psychosocial Factors: Stress, trauma, and other environmental factors can play a role in triggering or exacerbating DMS symptoms in susceptible individuals.

Treatment:
The treatment of DMS can be complex and typically involves a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the underlying condition and the specific delusional symptoms. Here are some common treatment approaches:

Medication: Antipsychotic medications, such as atypical antipsychotics, are often prescribed to manage delusional symptoms. These drugs can help alleviate distressing beliefs and improve overall functioning.

Psychotherapy: Individual psychotherapy, especially cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can help individuals challenge and modify their delusional beliefs. Therapists work with patients to develop coping strategies and improve reality testing.

Family Education and Support: Educating family members about the condition and involving them in the treatment process can be beneficial in providing a supportive environment and reducing distress.

Addressing Underlying Conditions: If DMS is associated with another psychiatric or medical condition, addressing that condition is essential. Treating the underlying cause can help alleviate DMS symptoms.

Hospitalization: In severe cases where the individual poses a danger to themselves or others due to their delusional beliefs, hospitalization may be necessary for their safety and stabilization.

It's important to note that treatment outcomes for DMS can vary widely, and some individuals may require ongoing care and support to manage their symptoms effectively. Early intervention and a comprehensive treatment plan can improve the prognosis for individuals with DMS. A psychiatrist or mental health professional should be consulted for a proper evaluation and treatment recommendations.

Penalty Guidelines for Doctors under NMC RMP Professional Conduct Regulations, 2023 (RMP Professional Conduct Regulation)

The National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023. These Regulations have come into force on 3rd August, 2023. The regulations focus on various aspects of a doctor‚Äôs responsibilities, including prescribing practices, professional qualifications, remuneration, and maintaining patient records.

The video is prepared with the purpose of bringing uniformity across the country in the assessment of liability and award of disciplinary action in case of Professional Misconduct as per the NMC regulations bearing the principle of proportionality in mind. In both civil and criminal cases, the law enforcement authorities and courts may expect the statutory bodies to examine the case and fix responsibility on RMP as per these regulations.

If misconduct of criminal nature not listed in the regulation is identified by the SMC or EMRB the same may be reported to the relevant lawful authority for further action.

During the assessment, the SMC/EMRB/NMC should consider and evaluate other issues that may have contributed to the situation being assessed, including the final outcome of the patient, beyond the role played by the doctor. The severity of the situation must be decided for each allegation made against the doctor. 

Level 1: Reformation-This may be awarded singly or in conjunction with other levels, in the form of advisory, instruction or warning.

Level 2: This penalty may be awarded even when the role of the doctor in causing direct harm was not conclusively proved but the doctor was found to have breached any of the codes listed above. The maximum action is a suspension of the license to practice for up to one month (30days).

Level 3: This penalty may be awarded when the role of the doctor in causing direct harm was conclusively proved and the doctor was found to have breached relevant regulation.
This maximum action is a suspension of the license to practice for a maximum period of three months. Holding suspension can be given in this level as per regulations.

Level 4: This penalty may be awarded when the role of the doctor in causing direct harm was conclusively proved and the doctor was found to have breached relevant regulations.
The maximum action is a suspension of the license to practice for a period ranging from 3 months to 3 years.

Level 5: The last resort is to debar a member permanently from practice (Permanent suspension of license). This penalty may be awarded only after a detailed inquiry, carried out by an Expert Group constituted under the Guidelines, finds that the treating doctor has committed a willful, or intentionally harm/unlawful, prohibited action. This will be taken as a ‚Äòunique case‚Äô and no precedent will need to be cited.

RMPs who have been exonerated and those who have completed penalties under Level 1 should not be barred from receiving ‚Äúgood standing‚Äù certificates if required later

These new regulations mark a significant step towards enhancing the accountability, transparency, and ethical standards within the medical profession. The Indian medical community awaits the positive impacts these regulations are expected to bring to the healthcare sector.

Social Media Guidelines under NMC RMP Professional Conduct Regulations, 2023 (RMP Professional Conduct Regulation)

The National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023. These Regulations have come into force on 3rd August, 2023. The regulations focus on various aspects of a doctor‚Äôs responsibilities, including prescribing practices, professional qualifications, remuneration, and maintaining patient records.

CONDUCT OF RMPs ON SOCIAL MEDIA

Key Principles:

(1) The broader principle of medical ethics should guide the use of social media by RMPs

(2) RMPs need to distinguish between telemedicine consultation and social media.

(3) All written and visual communication should be truthful, respectful, and professional.

Conduct:

1) RMPs can provide information and announcement on social media. However, the information should be factual and can be verified. The information should not be misleading or deceptive, nor should it exploit the patient‚Äôs vulnerability or lack of knowledge


2) RMPs should avoid discussing the treatment of patients on public social media or prescribing medicine to patients on the public social media platform. If a patient approaches doctors through public social media, the doctor should guide the patient toward a telemedicine consultation or in-person consultation as the situation warrants.

3). RMPs should not post patients‚Äô photographs or scan images (ct/pet scans) on social media. Once an image is posted in social media, it becomes data that is owned by the social media company or the general public.

4). RMPs behavior on social media towards his colleagues should be guided by general principles of medical ethics on professional behaviour.

5). RMPs should not directly or indirectly indulge in the practice of purchasing ‚Äúlikes‚Äù , ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù , or paying money so that search algorithms lead to their name being listed at the top or registering on software programs (apps) that charge fees for higher ratings or soliciting patients.

6). RMPs should not request or share patients ‚Äôtestimonials or recommendations or endorsements or reviews in social media.

7). RMPs should refrain from sharing images of healed/cured patients, or surgery/procedure videos or images displaying impressive results under any circumstances.

8). RMP is allowed to share educative material for the information of the general public. However, communication should be limited to the expertise of the RMP.

9). RMP‚Äôs webpage should also follow the same guidelines as above.

10). On social media, RMPs should refrain from boundary crossings or violations and conduct themselves with dignity and decorum.

11). Soliciting of patients directly or indirectly through social media is unethical

Patient Solicitation Prohibited: RMPs are forbidden from directly or indirectly soliciting patients, whether individually or as part of groups, institutions, or organizations.

These new regulations mark a significant step towards enhancing the accountability, transparency, and ethical standards within the medical profession. The Indian medical community awaits the positive impacts these regulations are expected to bring to the healthcare sector.

Dyscalculia [Maths difficulty] Arthimetic disability 

Dyscalculia is a term referring to a wide range of difficulties with maths, including weaknesses in understanding the meaning of numbers, and difficulty applying mathematical principles to solve problems

Studies have been done to try to identify predictors of potential mathematical disability. The main predictors include: 
- Not knowing which of two digits is larger, i.e. understanding the magnitude and relationship of numbers
- Lacking effective counting strategies
- Poor fluency in identification of numbers
- Inability to add simple single-digit numbers mentally
- Limitations in working memory capacity

If basic maths facts are not mastered, many teenagers and adults with dyscalculia may have difficulty moving on to more advanced maths applications. Additional language processing disorders can make it difficult for a person to grasp the vocabulary of maths. Without a clear understanding of this vocabulary, it is difficult to build on maths knowledge.

An evaluation reveals how a person understands and uses numbers and maths concepts to solve advanced-level, as well as everyday, problems. The evaluation compares a person‚Äôs expected level of performance (based on their educational history and the level of remediation they have received) and their current level of skill and understanding, while noting specific strengths and weaknesses.

Recognising a student‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses is the first step to getting help. Following identification, parents, teachers and other educators can work together to establish strategies that will help the student learn maths more effectively. 

Help outside of the classroom can assist a student to achieve mastery in areas of weakness before moving on to new topics. Repeated reinforcement and specific practice can make understanding easier.

Additional strategies to support individuals with dyscalculia can include:
- Explicit instruction in effective counting and calculation techniques
- Allow the use of calculators when mental maths is not the objective of the lesson
- Utilise number fact charts and times table charts to assist with recall
- Use graph paper to assist with lining up written work appropriately
- Focus on a few maths facts at a time and ensure mastery before introducing new facts
- Allow additional time to complete maths activities or reduce the number of questions students need to complete in class
- Play games that reinforce the maths concept

This video explains the broad purpose of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for all registered medical practitioners. It also outlines the process of delivery of CPD programmes, the assignment of CPD points, the linkage of CPD points with renewal of licences by the EMRB or the State Medical Council, and the penalties involved in the event of non-compliance to mandated CPD requirements. Emphasis will be on creating culture where RMPs do not view CPD and recertification as a threat but as a responsibility to provide patient care and services of highest order.

The National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023. These Regulations have come into force on 3rd August, 2023. The regulations focus on various aspects of a doctor‚Äôs responsibilities, including prescribing practices, professional qualifications, remuneration, and maintaining patient records.

CPD can be defined as:

‚ÄúThe wide-ranging competencies beyond clinical update, research and scientific writing, multidisciplinary context of patient care, ethical practice, communication, management and behavioural skills, team building, information technology, audit, and appropriate attitudinal change to ensure improved patient outcomes and satisfaction‚Äù


CPD programmes may take the form of face-to-face (Category 1 and 2), online/self-paced or hybrid forms, depending on the nature of the CPD. Not more than 50% of CPD shall be online/virtual/hybrid (Category 3). 

Category 3 also includes Scholarly work and publications by Academician/RMP. Scholarly
activities/CPD carried out by RMP internationally through conferences/ research work


Attempts must be made to ensure that CPD involves active participation and not merely attendance of an event. If the CPD is being conducted online, organisers must indicate how they intend to ensure active participation during the entire programme.


Every RMP is responsible to meet their mandated CPD points on a yearly basis. Every RMP is required to maintain a record of their CPD points and RMP/ SMC/EMRB to update onto the EMRB/State Medical Council portal on a regular basis. CPD credits must be obtained every year. It is expected to obtain 6 CPD points every year but at least 3 credit
points must be obtained per year. Emphasis shall be on regularity of participation in CPD. A minimum of 30 CPD credit points must be obtained at the end of 5 years for renewal of license.

These new regulations mark a significant step towards enhancing the accountability, transparency, and ethical standards within the medical profession. The Indian medical community awaits the positive impacts these regulations are expected to bring to the healthcare sector.

To summarize, the ensure continued competence, RMPs are mandated to attend regular professional development programs, totaling at least 30 credit hours every five years. License renewal is required every five years, and RMPs must pay the necessary fee to practice in specific states.

e pharmacy [Online Pharmacy] Laws 

An e-pharmacy, also known as an online pharmacy or internet pharmacy, is a digital platform that allows users to purchase prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as other health-related products, through the internet. These online pharmacies operate similarly to traditional brick-and-mortar pharmacies but offer the convenience of ordering medications from the comfort of one's home.

Key features of e-pharmacies typically include:

Online Ordering: Customers can browse through a wide range of medicines and healthcare products on the e-pharmacy website or app. They can select the items they need and place an order online.

Prescription Verification: For prescription medications, customers are often required to upload a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. The e-pharmacy team reviews and verifies the prescription before processing the order.

Home Delivery: One of the main advantages of e-pharmacies is that they deliver the ordered medications and products to the customer's doorstep, eliminating the need for the customer to physically visit a pharmacy.

Medicine Information: Online pharmacies typically provide detailed information about the medicines they offer, including usage instructions, side effects, precautions, and potential drug interactions.

Discounts and Offers: Many e-pharmacies provide discounts, promotional offers, and loyalty programs to attract and retain customers.

Confidentiality and Privacy: Reputable e-pharmacies take privacy and security seriously, ensuring that personal and medical information of customers is protected.

It is essential to exercise caution when using e-pharmacies and to choose reputable platforms. Customers should verify the legitimacy of the online pharmacy, look for proper licensing and accreditations, and read reviews and feedback from other customers before making a purchase. Additionally, customers should be wary of e-pharmacies that sell prescription medications without a valid prescription, as it is crucial for patient safety and compliance with the law to obtain medicines only with a prescription when required.

Keep in mind that regulations related to e-pharmacies can vary significantly from one country to another, so it's essential to understand the local laws and guidelines regarding online medication purchases.

The laws governing e-pharmacies in India were primarily regulated by the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. However, please note that regulations might have evolved or changed since then. It's always best to check for the latest updates from official sources or legal authorities. Here are some key points about e-pharmacy regulations in India based on the information available up to September 2021:

Legality and Licensing: E-pharmacies in India were required to obtain necessary licenses and registrations to operate legally. The licensing requirements may differ based on whether they are operating on a marketplace model or inventory-based model.

Central Licensing Authority: E-pharmacies were regulated by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) under the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).

Prescription Medications: Selling prescription medicines online required a valid prescription from a registered medical practitioner. The e-pharmacies were expected to verify and validate the prescription before dispensing the medication.

Prohibition in Certain States: Some Indian states had imposed temporary bans or restrictions on the functioning of e-pharmacies within their territories. However, there were efforts to resolve the issue through legal proceedings and policy changes.

Data Privacy and Security: E-pharmacies were expected to comply with relevant data protection laws and ensure the privacy and security of customers' personal and health-related information.

Advertisement Guidelines: E-pharmacies had to adhere to specific guidelines concerning the advertising and promotion of medicines and healthcare products.

It's crucial to remember that regulations are subject to change, and new laws or amendments may have been introduced since my last update. To get the most current and accurate information regarding e-pharmacy regulations in India, it is advisable to consult official government sources or seek legal advice from professionals familiar with the healthcare and pharmaceutical laws in the country.

e-health - Ethical and legal issues [Digital Health Regulating Laws]

 e-health, also known as electronic health or telehealth, refers to the utilization of electronic information and communication technologies in the healthcare industry. It encompasses a wide range of digital tools, systems, and services that facilitate the delivery and management of healthcare services, information, and resources.

Some key components of e-health include:

1. Electronic Health Records (EHRs): These are digital versions of patients' medical records, including their medical history, medications, test results, and other relevant health information. EHRs enable healthcare providers to access and share patient information securely, leading to improved coordination and continuity of care.

2. Telemedicine: This involves the remote delivery of healthcare services, consultations, and medical information through telecommunications technologies. It allows patients to interact with healthcare professionals and receive medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment without the need for in-person visits. Telemedicine is particularly beneficial for patients in rural or underserved areas, as well as those with mobility constraints.

3. Mobile Health (mHealth): mHealth refers to health-related services and information delivered through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It includes health and wellness apps, wearable health monitoring devices (e.g., fitness trackers), and remote patient monitoring systems.

4. Health Information Exchange (HIE): HIE allows the electronic sharing of patient health information between different healthcare organizations and providers. This facilitates seamless and secure communication, ensuring that healthcare professionals have access to relevant patient data, regardless of their location.

5. Online Health Resources: E-health encompasses various online platforms and websites that offer health information, patient education materials, and virtual support communities.

6. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM): RPM involves the use of connected medical devices to collect and transmit patients' health data to healthcare providers. This helps in the continuous monitoring of chronic conditions and enables timely interventions based on real-time data.

7. E-prescribing: E-prescribing allows healthcare providers to electronically send prescriptions to pharmacies, improving accuracy, reducing medication errors, and enhancing patient safety.

E-health has the potential to enhance healthcare accessibility, efficiency, and quality, making it a valuable and rapidly evolving field within the healthcare industry. However, it's essential to ensure that patient data is handled securely and that appropriate privacy measures are in place to protect sensitive health information. As technology continues to advance, the scope and impact of e-health are likely to expand further.

As with any healthcare system that incorporates electronic information and communication technologies, e-health in India raises certain ethical and legal issues. Here are some of the key concerns:

1. Privacy and Data Security: Protecting patient data from unauthorized access, breaches, and misuse is a significant ethical concern. E-health platforms must adhere to strict data security measures and comply with applicable privacy regulations to safeguard patient confidentiality.

Principles of Neuronal Plasticity (Neural Plasticity)

Neural plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, refers to the brain's ability to change and reorganize itself by forming new neural connections, modifying existing ones, and adjusting the strength of synaptic connections. It involves the structural and functional alterations that occur in the brain's neural networks in response to various factors, including learning, experience, development, aging, and environmental influences.

Neural plasticity is a fundamental property of the brain that allows it to adapt and optimize its function in response to internal and external stimuli. It underlies the brain's capacity for learning, memory formation, skill acquisition, and recovery from injuries or diseases. Through the processes of synaptic potentiation, synaptic pruning, axonal sprouting, and neurogenesis, neural plasticity enables the brain to remodel its neural circuits, reorganize its functions, and compensate for damage or changes in sensory inputs.

The concept of neural plasticity challenges the traditional view that the brain is a fixed and static organ after a certain stage of development. Instead, it emphasizes the brain's dynamic nature and its potential for change throughout life. This understanding has significant implications for fields such as neuroscience, psychology, education, and rehabilitation, as it highlights the importance of providing appropriate stimulation, training, and environmental conditions to promote positive plastic changes and optimize brain function.

Neuronal plasticity, also known as neuroplasticity, refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt throughout an individual's life. It involves the modification of neural connections and networks in response to various factors, including learning, experience, and environmental influences. The principles of neuronal plasticity explain how these changes occur. Here are some key principles:

1. Use it or lose it: Neurons that are frequently and actively used tend to strengthen their connections, while those that are not used may weaken and eventually be eliminated. This principle highlights the importance of continued engagement and stimulation to maintain and enhance neural connections.

2. Specificity: Plasticity is specific to the stimuli or experiences encountered. Different parts of the brain are responsible for processing different types of information or skills. Consequently, plastic changes occur in specific neural pathways that are relevant to the particular task or input.

3. Repetition matters: Repeated exposure to a stimulus or experience strengthens the synaptic connections involved in processing that stimulus. The more frequently a neural pathway is activated, the stronger it becomes. This principle underlies the concept of practice and the importance of repetition in learning and skill development.

4. Timing matters: The timing of neuronal activity is critical for plastic changes to occur. The brain is more receptive to plasticity during critical periods, which are specific developmental stages when neural connections are particularly susceptible to modification. Timing also affects the degree and direction of plastic changes.

5. Hebbian plasticity: This principle is often summarized by the phrase "neurons that fire together, wire together." It suggests that when two neurons are repeatedly activated at the same time, the strength of their connection increases. This process, known as synaptic potentiation, is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory formation.

6. Competition and pruning: Plasticity involves not only the strengthening of relevant neural connections but also the elimination of unnecessary or weaker connections. This competitive aspect ensures efficient neural processing by refining and optimizing neural circuits through a process called synaptic pruning.

7. Environmental influence: Environmental factors, such as enriched or impoverished environments, can significantly impact neuronal plasticity. Stimulating and challenging environments promote plastic changes and enhance cognitive abilities, while deprivation or negative environments can impede or disrupt plasticity.

8. Adaptation to change: Neuronal plasticity enables the brain to adapt to changes in the environment, such as injury or sensory loss. In response to such changes, the brain can reorganize its neural connections, allowing for functional recovery or compensation.

These principles of neuronal plasticity illustrate the remarkable ability of the brain to rewire and reorganize itself throughout life. They provide a foundation for understanding how learning, experience, and environmental factors shape our brain's structure and function.

World Health Day 2024: "My health, my right"

Every year, on April 7th, the world celebrates World Health Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about global health issues and highlighting the importance of health for all. The theme for World Health Day 2024 is "My health, my right," emphasizing the fundamental right of every individual to access healthcare services without discrimination or financial hardship.

Health is a basic human right, as enshrined in the World Health Organization's constitution, which states that "the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition." Despite this, millions of people around the world still lack access to essential health services, facing barriers such as poverty, inequality, and lack of infrastructure.

The theme "My health, my right" highlights the need for individuals to be empowered to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. It emphasizes the importance of promoting health literacy and ensuring that people have access to accurate and reliable information about health and healthcare services. It also calls for the elimination of barriers that prevent people from accessing healthcare, such as discrimination, stigma, and financial constraints.

One of the key goals of World Health Day 2024 is to promote universal health coverage (UHC), ensuring that everyone can access the healthcare services they need, when and where they need them, without facing financial hardship. UHC is not just about providing access to healthcare services but also about ensuring that those services are of high quality and meet the needs of individuals and communities.

Achieving UHC requires a concerted effort from governments, healthcare providers, civil society, and the private sector. It requires investment in healthcare infrastructure, training healthcare workers, and ensuring that essential medicines and technologies are available and affordable. It also requires addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, which can have a significant impact on people's health outcomes.

Delusional Disorder [Paranoia] Persistent Delusional Disorder [Paranoid Disorder]

Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that are firmly held despite evidence to the contrary. Individuals with delusional disorder generally do not exhibit other symptoms of psychosis, such as disorganized thinking or bizarre behavior.

It's important to note that individuals with delusional disorder genuinely believe in the reality of their delusions, and attempts to persuade them otherwise are often met with resistance. However, their delusions typically do not interfere with their ability to function in day-to-day life, and they may maintain normal social relationships and occupational functioning.


Delusional disorder can be categorized into different types based on the content of the delusions. 

1. Erotomanic Type: This type involves the delusion that someone, usually of higher social status, is in love with the individual. Despite lacking any evidence or reciprocation, the person with delusional disorder believes that the object of their affection is secretly in love with them.

2. Grandiose Type: Individuals with grandiose delusional disorder have an exaggerated sense of self-worth, power, knowledge, or identity. They may believe they have exceptional talents, abilities, or achievements, often of a supernatural or divine nature.

3. Jealous Type: This type of delusional disorder involves the unfounded belief that one's partner is unfaithful. The individual with delusional jealousy may interpret innocent gestures or events as evidence of infidelity and may engage in vigilant behaviors to gather proof.

4. Persecutory Type: People with persecutory delusional disorder have a strong conviction that they are being mistreated, harassed, or conspired against. They may believe they are being followed, spied upon, or targeted for harm, despite a lack of evidence.

5. Somatic Type: This type of delusional disorder focuses on bodily functions or sensations. Individuals with somatic delusions often believe they have a medical condition or physical defect that is not supported by medical evaluation.

6. Mixed Type: This category is used when the delusions do not clearly fit into one specific type or when multiple types of delusions are present simultaneously.

It's important to note that these types are not mutually exclusive, and an individual may experience delusions from different categories or have mixed features. A comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary to determine the specific type of delusional disorder and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

The treatment of delusional disorder typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy. It's important to note that treatment approaches can vary based on individual needs, and consulting with a mental health professional is essential for an accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment plan. Here are some common approaches:

1. Medication: Antipsychotic medications are often prescribed to help manage the symptoms of delusional disorder. These medications can help reduce the intensity and frequency of delusions. The choice of medication and dosage will depend on the specific symptoms and needs of the individual. It's important to work closely with a psychiatrist who can monitor the effects of the medication and make any necessary adjustments.

2. Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), can be beneficial for individuals with delusional disorder. CBT aims to identify and challenge irrational beliefs and thought patterns associated with the delusions. It helps individuals develop more realistic and adaptive ways of thinking and coping with their symptoms. Additionally, therapy can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for individuals to express their experiences and concerns.

3. Family therapy: In some cases, involving family members or close loved ones in therapy can be helpful. Family therapy can educate and support family members, helping them understand the nature of delusional disorder and learn effective ways to communicate and provide support. It can also assist in addressing any dysfunctional family dynamics that may contribute to the maintenance of delusions.

Hospitalization: In severe cases where an individual's safety or the safety of others is at risk, or when the person is unable to care for themselves, hospitalization may be necessary. This provides a structured and supportive environment where immediate safety concerns can be addressed, and medications can be adjusted or monitored more closely.

It's important to remember that treatment for delusional disorder can be challenging, as individuals with this disorder often have difficulty recognizing their delusions as false. However, with ongoing support, patience, and appropriate interventions, many individuals with delusional disorder can experience improvements in their symptoms and overall functioning.

Electroconvulsive Therapy in Geriatric Population [Part 6] ECT in Geriatric Population

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a form of psychiatric treatment that involves inducing seizures with the use of electrical stimulation while an individual is under general anesthesia. ECT is primarily indicated in people who require a rapid treatment response due to the severity of their condition such as violent patients or risk for suicide or catatonia. ECT has also been shown to be relatively safe in geriatric population and may offer some advantages over antidepressants in minimizing exposure to side-effects of psychotropic medications.

The indications for ECT in the old-old are the same as in younger adults. The most common indication is severe major depression. ECT is often the treatment of choice in the elderly patient whose depression presents with life-threatening symptoms or behavior, such as suicidality or refusal to eat, or in patients with catatonia or psychosis. In these situations, waiting for one or more medication trials can be unwise. A history of favorable response to ECT in past episodes of severe depression should also suggest going directly to ECT.

Other important indications include severe bipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder and other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar mania. Neuropsychiatric disorders that respond to ECT include Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and dementing disorders with depression. Patients with less severe types of depression are often referred for ECT when they do not respond to medication trials.

Consideration of potential candidates for ECT requires assessment of potential benefits as well as potential risks in older patients. Most of the risks and complications of ECT are related to anesthesia and the physiological effects of the induced seizure. Therefore, knowledge of these effects and how they impact the cardiovascular and neurologic systems helps the clinician anticipate complications and minimize risks before the procedure in geriatric population.

The studies indicate excellent efficacy for ECT in geriatric patients. Adverse cognitive effects of ECT in this population are usually transient and not typically severe. In addition, continuation/maintenance ECT may be a favorable strategy for relapse prevention in the elderly after a successful acute course of ECT. 

ECT is an important treatment option for depressed geriatric patients with severe and/or treatment-resistant illness. New evidence demonstrate that ECT is a highly effective, safe, and well-tolerated antidepressant treatment option for geriatric patients.

Electroconvulsive Therapy During Pregnancy and Postpartum [Part 5] ECT in Perinatal Period

Psychiatric disorders are common in pregnancy, affecting 15-29% of pregnant women. Untreated depression has negative health consequences for mother and fetus. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective option for the treatment of severe depression, high suicide risk, catatonia, medication-resistant illness, psychotic agitation, severe physical decline, and other life-threatening conditions.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a form of psychiatric treatment that involves inducing seizures with the use of electrical stimulation while an individual is under general anesthesia. ECT is primarily indicated in people who require a rapid treatment response due to the severity of their condition such as violent patients or risk for suicide or catatonia. ECT has also been shown to be relatively safe during pregnancy and may offer some advantages over antidepressants in minimizing exposure to psychotropic medications during pregnancy.

While the patient is under full general anesthesia, a muscle relaxant is given and electrodes are applied to the scalp. A brief electrical stimulus is delivered. The effective stimuli produce a mild seizure which changes the activity of the brain. The brain stimulation is accompanied by mild muscle contractions usually lasting less than one minute.

The risks associated with ECT during pregnancy and post-partum are similar to those observed in non-pregnant individuals receiving ECT and include transient memory disruption, confusion, nausea and vomiting, muscle soreness, and headaches. 

The indication and appropriateness of ECT in pregnancy must be carefully weighed against the risks of untreated maternal illness and those of alternative treatment options. The safety of ECT in pregnancy has been documented over the last 50 years. The adverse effects in pregnancy are similar to the risks of ECT in any individual. The most common risk to the mother is premature contractions and preterm labor, which occur infrequently and are not clearly caused by ECT. The rates of miscarriages were not significantly different from that of the general population. There have been no associations of ECT with congenital anomalies, either morphologic or behavioral, and no neurocognitive disturbances in the child

ECT is a reasonably safe, rapid resolution of symptoms and effective treatment for management of many psychiatric disorders in pregnant patients and also during post-partum period. For women with less severe depression, ECT may not be an attractive option.  However, for women with severe psychiatric symptoms, including suicidality, psychosis, infanticidal, homicidal or manic/mixed symptoms, ECT should be considered as a first line treatment.

Electroconvulsive Therapy in Child and Adolescents Population [ECT in Children] Part 4

ECT use in children and adolescents is considered a highly efficient option for treating several psychiatric disorders, achieving high remission rates, and presenting few and relatively benign adverse effects. Risks can be mitigated by the correct use of the technique and are considered minimal when compared to the efficiency of ECT in treating psychopathologies.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a form of psychiatric treatment that involves inducing seizures with the use of electrical stimulation while an individual is under general anesthesia. ECT is primarily indicated in people who require a rapid treatment response due to the severity of their condition such as violent patients or risk for suicide or catatonia.

Even after the development of psychopharmacology in the 1950s, ECT maintains its relevance for psychiatry. Nowadays, ECT is still considered a highly efficient option for treatment of several psychiatric disorders, achieving high rates of remission, with few and relatively benign adverse effects.

ECT requires multiple treatments. The treatments are divided into two series of treatments, acute and maintenance. During the acute series, ECT treatments are given three times a week for a total of 6 to 12 treatments for the majority of patients. Prior to each treatment, the patient is evaluated for improvement.

Before beginning a series of ECT treatments, a patient should receive a thorough psychiatric assessment, a medical examination and sometimes a basic blood test and an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check heart health. While the patient is under full general anesthesia, a muscle relaxant is given and electrodes are applied to the scalp. A brief electrical stimulus is delivered. The effective stimuli produce a mild seizure which changes the activity of the brain. The brain stimulation is accompanied by mild muscle contractions usually lasting less than one minute.

The electrical stimulus can be delivered in one of three ways; right unilateral, bi-frontal or bi-lateral. Most patients begin treatments with a right unilateral stimulus. If, after several treatments, the patient is not improving, the stimulus can be changed. The benefit of changing to bi-frontal or bi-lateral is a faster improvement in mood. The risk is an increased chance of memory loss. The decision to change the electrical stimulus is made by the patient and the psychiatrist.

ECT is the treatment of choice depending on diagnosis, severity of symptoms, and lack of response to psychopharmacotherapy. The majority of the studies in the scientific literature show the efficiency of ECT use in adolescents and consider this approach more efficient than psychopharmacotherapy isolated.

Before beginning a series of ECT treatments, a patient should receive a thorough psychiatric assessment, a medical examination and sometimes a basic blood test and an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check heart health.

Informed consent is another important part of the process. A patient must provide written informed consent before ECT is administered. In situations where a person is too ill to make decisions for him or herself, the consent process is governed by state law (for example, a court-appointed guardian).

Patients and their families should discuss all options for treatment with the psychiatrist before making a specific treatment decision. They should be provided with sufficient information to fully understand the procedure and the potential benefits, risks, and side effects of each treatment option before providing written consent.

A patient typically receives ECT two or three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments, depending on the severity of symptoms and how quickly the symptoms respond to the treatment.

At the time of each treatment a patient is given general anesthesia and a muscle relaxant and electrodes are attached to the scalp at precise locations. The patient's brain is stimulated with a brief controlled series of electrical pulses. This causes a seizure within the brain that lasts for approximately a minute. The patient is asleep for the procedure and awakens after 5-10 minutes, much as from minor surgery.

Sinusoidal wave Vs Brief Pulse ECT

Current flows almost continuously with the sinusoidal waveform. As a result, far more electrical charge is delivered than is necessary to trigger the seizure. The extra charge may not increase efficacy but does increase the cognitive adverse effects of the treatment. In contrast, with constant current, brief-pulse ECT devices, current is delivered in short pulses. The seizure which is triggered can be as effective as that with sinusoidal wave ECT, and is associated with less cognitive adverse effects.

According to Ohm‚Äôs law, the current in a circuit is inversely proportional to the resistance. As resistance varies from patient to patient, at the constant voltage the current in the circuit and hence the electrical charge delivered during ECT will also vary from patient to patient. 

Relationship between electrical current and therapeutic effects 

Higher electrical doses are associated with a greater proportion of responders in patients who receive right unilateral ECT and also it is associated with faster response to ECT. However, higher electrical doses are associated with greater cognitive adverse effects.

The introduction of convulsive therapy to psychiatry and changes in seizure induction from chemical to electrical are outlined. The place of ECT in contemporary psychiatry, particularly its most important clinical indications, is briefly discussed. Negative media representation and historical misuse are likely to have contributed to negative professional and public attitudes towards ECT

Effectiveness: ECT has shown a high level of efficacy in the treatment of some conditions. It can be particularly beneficial to people with severe depression, psychosis, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

There are two types of ECT:

Bilateral ECT, in which the electrodes are placed on both sides of the head. This is designed to affect the entire brain.

Unilateral ECT, in which one electrode is placed on top of the head and the other on one temple, usually the right. In this case, the current only passes through one side of the brain.

ECT is probably the most controversial form of treatment in medicine. It has been banned in certain parts of the world while remaining widely practiced in other countries. In the last two decades several new neurostimulation methods have been introduced in psychiatry mainly from the field of neurology. These include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation.

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Part 1 [Shock treatment] History of ECT

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a form of psychiatric treatment that involves inducing seizures with the use of electrical stimulation while an individual is under general anesthesia.

ECT is primarily indicated in people who require a rapid treatment response due to the severity of their condition such as violent patients or risk for suicide or catatonia.

History of ECT 

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is one of the oldest and most controversial treatments in the field of psychiatry. Convulsive therapy was introduced by Dr Laszl√≥ Meduna. He observed that seizures and psychosis do not co-exist. Whenever, psychosis patient had seizure behavioural problems vanished. Hence, Meduna planned to induce a seizure using a chemical agent and proceeded to test the safety and effectiveness of several epileptogenic compounds for this purpose. Finally, Meduna identified camphor as the compound that satisfied his requirements. Although camphor was later replaced with intravenous cardiazol, chemical seizure induction remained somewhat unpredictable, with considerable interpersonal variance.

The idea of using electricity to induce seizure first occurred to Cerletti and Bini when they witnessed cardiazol therapy in Vienna. Ugo Cerletti and Lucio Bini used an electric current to elicit an epileptic seizure for therapeutic purposes. They performed the first electric seizure induction in a psychotic patient named Enrico X on April 11, 1938. 

ECT may offer a number of important benefits, including:

Ketamine in Preventing Acute Suicidal Behaviors [Part 3] Ketamine - An Antisuicidal Medicine

Ketamine has been shown to relieve severe depression symptoms in a matter of hours, and low doses of the drug can disrupt the suicidal crisis in those with severe depression. Ketamine does this with its calming effects on the brain and by changing the brain‚Äôs structure of synapses, the points at which the nerves conduct signals. Essentially, ketamine is changing the path for important neurotransmitters in many essential areas of your brain.

Studies have found that ketamine infusions can be used to treat a variety of medical issues, such as chronic pain, migraines, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. 

Multiple sessions of ketamine infusions over several weeks can be a life-saving approach for those with suicidal behavior and a relief for those with other conditions.

Challenges in managing suicidal patients 

Suicide is a devastating public health crisis with few available treatments that can quickly reduce the intensity of self-harm thoughts. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that globally, more than 700,000 people die due to suicide every year. Current treatment for acutely suicidal patients are limited to hospitalization, psychotherapy, electro-convulsant therapy, or a combination of the aforementioned. But all these treatment are helpful in long-term but not in acute crisis. At present we do not have any robust acute antisuicidal treatment across the globe. 

A single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine or intranasal ketamine, administered in the medical setting may reduce the intensity of depression and suicidal ideation in a rapid and sustained manner.

Efficacy of Ketamine in Treatment Resistant Depression [Part 2]

Major depressive disorder affects tens of millions of people each year. One-third of those affected have depression that is resistant to conventional pharmacologic, psychologic, or somatic treatments. Patients with treatment-resistant depression have few remedies other than electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation. Ketamine's effect on certain receptors in the brain that is responsible for its positive results. Specifically, ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and, in this role, provides "rapid antidepressant effects" in people with treatment-resistant depression.

Recent research has highlighted the promising antidepressant effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusions. Evidence from various trials suggest that ketamine significantly decreased depression severity ratings at short-term assessment intervals, whereas evidence examining the long-term effects is lacking. 

Ketamine is a medication-based option for treatment-resistant depression that, unlike ECT and TMS, doesn't require the use of specialized devices. Ketamine also offers patients faster relief, sometimes easing depression after just a single dose of IV ketamine 

Ketamine infusion therapy was generally well tolerated, with minimal untoward effects. Large, randomized controlled trials are needed to discern the longer-term efficacy, tolerance, and dependence profiles of ketamine infusions. 

The anesthetic ketamine has become popular over the past decade as a remedy for depressed patients who have become resistant to standard treatments. 

Ketamine comes in several forms. The only one that the FDA has approved as a medication for depression is a nasal spray called esketamine (Spravato). It‚Äôs for adults who either haven‚Äôt been helped by antidepressant pills, have major depressive disorder, or are suicidal. For treatment-resistant depression, patients usually get the nasal spray twice a week for 1 to 4 weeks; then once a week for weeks 5 to 9; and then once every week or 2 after that

The IV infusion lasts about 40 minutes. The dissociative experience starts quickly and takes about 15 to 20 minutes to wear off after the drip ends. A doctor is always on site during the whole process. Doctors who administer IV ketamine tend to recommend patients continue with their regular antidepressant regimen, too. As for the nasal spray, it‚Äôs only approved for use along with an oral antidepressant.

Ketamine has a robust and rapid effect on depression, which was seen immediately after the administration of ketamine and sustained at the end of 6weeks. Ketamine is a new and effective option in future with rapid onset of action.

Ketamine Use in Psychiatry [Part 1]

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used medically for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is also used as a recreational drug. It is one of the safest anesthetics,  it does not suppresses respiration or heart rate. 

Ketamine is a novel compound, derived from PCP, created in pursuit of a safer anesthetic with similar characteristics. Ketamine is also used for acute pain management. At anesthetic doses, ketamine induces a state of "dissociative anesthesia", a trance-like state providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia. The distinguishing features of ketamine anesthesia are preserved breathing and airway reflexes, stimulated heart function with increased blood pressure, and moderate bronchodilation.  At lower, sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine is a promising agent for pain and treatment-resistant depression. However, the antidepressant action of a single administration of ketamine wanes with time. The long-term effects of repeated use are largely unknown, and are an area of active investigation.

NMHP Critique [Review and Recommendations of NMHP]

The National Mental Health Program (NMHP) of India was launched in 1982 with the aim of providing mental health services to the people and integrating mental health care with general health care. The program sought to ensure the availability of minimum mental health care for all and encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in the social development of the country. Here are some key features and components of the NMHP:

Integration with General Health Services:

One of the primary objectives of NMHP was to integrate mental health services into the existing health care system. This integration aimed to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues and increase accessibility to mental health care.
District Mental Health Program (DMHP):

The NMHP emphasized the establishment of District Mental Health Programmes (DMHP) to provide mental health services at the district level. These programs were designed to offer comprehensive mental health care, including outpatient and inpatient services, to the population.
Human Resource Development:

The program focused on training health care professionals at various levels to handle mental health issues. This included training medical officers, primary health care workers, and community health workers to identify and manage mental health problems.

Promotion of Community Participation:

NMHP aimed to involve communities in mental health awareness and treatment. This involved creating awareness about mental health issues at the community level and encouraging community participation in the planning and implementation of mental health programs.

Prevention and Promotion Activities:

The program recognized the importance of preventive and promotional activities in mental health. This involved creating awareness about mental health, reducing risk factors, and promoting mental well-being in the community.

Treatment Facilities and Rehabilitation:

NMHP focused on the establishment of mental health treatment facilities and rehabilitation centers. This included the provision of psychiatric drugs and the development of rehabilitation services for individuals with mental illnesses.

Improving the National Mental Health Program (NMHP) of India involves a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach. Here are several key strategies that could contribute to enhancing the effectiveness and impact of the NMHP:

Increase Budgetary Allocation:

Allocate a higher budget for mental health programs to ensure the availability of sufficient resources for the implementation of services, infrastructure development, training, and research.


Workforce Training and Capacity Building:

Invest in ongoing training and capacity building for health care professionals at all levels to improve their skills in identifying, treating, and managing mental health issues. This includes training for general health care workers, community health workers, and mental health specialists.


Community Engagement and Awareness:

Implement community-based awareness campaigns to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues. Involve communities in mental health promotion activities and empower them to play an active role in identifying and supporting individuals with mental health challenges.
Integration with Primary Health Care:

Telemedicine and Technology Integration:

Leverage technology, including telemedicine and mobile health applications, to increase access to mental health services, especially in remote and underserved areas. This could improve follow-up care and monitoring of patients.

Collaboration with NGOs and Civil Society:

Foster collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, and civil society to enhance the reach and impact of mental health programs. These partnerships can contribute to community engagement and mobilization.

Monitoring and Evaluation:

Implement robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to regularly assess the performance and impact of the NMHP. This includes tracking key indicators, identifying bottlenecks, and making data-driven adjustments.

Addressing Substance Abuse:

Strengthen efforts to prevent and address substance abuse issues through integrated approaches that combine prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services.

Continuous evaluation, adaptation to emerging challenges, and a commitment to a holistic and inclusive approach are crucial for the sustained improvement of the National Mental Health Program in India. Collaboration between government agencies, healthcare providers, communities, and various stakeholders is essential for success.

Coping with Medical Malpractice Suits; Guidelines for Doctors

A malpractice suit can have a devastating impact on a practitioner's professional and personal life. The physician's reaction to this event is profound, affecting his own life-style and that of family, colleagues, patients and society at large.

Deeper understanding of the emotional, physical and behavioral reactions can help physicians to cope with the problems inherent in a malpractice suit and to maintain a greater stability in their personal lives. Adverse effects on medical practice suits impact can be minimized by proper precautions. 

The malpractice claim begins to affect all aspects of doctor's life. They don‚Äôt sleep well, don't interact well with family members, friends, or colleagues. After remaining dedicated to providing the best possible care, but they find themself taking a more conservative approach with patients - which is well known as - DEFENSIVE PRACTICE 

If the lawsuit proceeds to trial, doctors will face the uncertainty that accompanies any courtroom process. And that process can be lengthy, dominating their personal and professional life for many years to decades- its a longstanding battle. Facing a medical malpractice lawsuit will almost certainly be one of the most trying experiences you encounter as a physician, adding to the pressures of an already demanding profession. The lawsuit will generate an array of negative emotions, from self-doubt to high levels of stress and anxiety.

Approach the lawsuit simply as an unfortunate consequence of practicing medicine, the price of being a physician. In today‚Äôs medical climate, a lawsuit is essentially inevitable, especially if you conduct procedures. Treat the litigation as another necessary part of your career, and take the same approach as you would toward other hurdles like a board exam. Be meticulous. Go over your chart. Familiarize yourself with every aspect of the case. Be ready for your meetings with your attorney, and take an active role in your defense. 

Remember, in medical malpractice suit situation, no one in the room knows the case better than you. Approach your testimony the same way you approach a talk at a conference‚Äîyou are the expert, the master of that topic. This is your case, and you took care of the patient. That will reinforce your confidence and help you stay calm in the face of aggressive questions from the opposing attorney. 

Talking with your family is another vital step. The impact on family members can be substantial. Do not isolate yourself. Seek support and engage your family and friends. 

In coping with medical error, it may be necessary for some physicians to develop a more realistic, less idealized, and more forgiving sense of personal identity, competence, and self-confidence. Errors in decision making cannot be avoided throughout one‚Äôs career. One of the healthiest responses is recognition of the error and the development of a plan to decrease the likelihood of future similar occurrences. This activity often provides comfort and healing to the physician.

Doctors should recognize that being a defendant in a medical professional liability lawsuit can be one of life‚Äôs most stressful experiences. Negative emotions in response to a lawsuit are normal and physicians may need help from professionals or peers to cope with this stress

Legal Aspects of Informed Consent (Part 3)

The element of consent is one of the critical issues in medical treatment. The patient has a legal right to autonomy and self determination enshrined within Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. He can refuse treatment except in an emergency situation where the doctor need not get consent for treatment. The consent obtained should be legally valid. A doctor who treats without valid consent will be liable under the tort and criminal laws. The law presumes the doctor to be in a dominating position, hence the consent should be obtained after providing all the necessary information.

The principle of autonomy is enshrined within Art. 21 of the Indian Constitution, which deals with the right to life and personal liberty. The expression personal liberty under Art. 21 is of the widest amplitude and covers a wide variety of rights, including the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, and any act which damages, injures, or interferes with the use of any limb or faculty of a person, either permanently or temporarily. However, the common law application of consent is not fully developed in India, although the Indian courts have often referred to these principles. In such situations, obviously one has to refer to the principles of the Indian Contract Act and the Indian Penal Code. The relationship between a medical professional and his patient is a contract by parties competent to contract giving rise to contractual obligations. 

Consent is perhaps the only principle that runs through all aspects of health care provisions today. It also represents the legal and ethical expression of the basic right to have one's autonomy and self-determination. If a medical practitioner attempts to treat a person without valid consent, then he will be liable under both tort and criminal law. Tort is a civil wrong for which the aggrieved party may seek compensation from the wrong doer. The consequences would be payment of compensation (in civil) and imprisonment (in criminal). 

To commence, the patient may sue the medical practitioner in tort for trespass to person. Alternatively, the health professional may be sued for negligence. In certain extreme cases, there is a theoretical possibility of criminal prosecution for assault or battery. The traditional definition of battery is an act that directly and either intentionally or negligently causes some physical contact with another person without that person's consent. If a person has consented to contact expressedly or by implication, then there is no battery. It is a rare case in which a doctor would be held liable for criminal breach, unless there is gross disrespect to the patient's bodily autonomy, for instance, if a patient's organs are taken without his consent.

Consent is a legal requirement of medical practice and not a procedural formality. Getting a mere signature on a form is no consent. If a patient is rushed into signing consent, without giving sufficient information, the consent may be invalid, despite the signature. Often medical professionals either ignore or are ignorant of the requirements of a valid consent and its legal implications. Instances where either consent was not taken or when an invalid consent was obtained have been a subject matter of judicial scrutiny in several medical malpractice cases.

Evolution of Informed Consent (Part 2)

The concept of informed consent has evolved significantly with regard to both the practice of medicine and research conducted with human volunteers. Yet the process of informed consent used in clinical research and the lengthy consent documents that are difficult to comprehend have been criticized.

The 1914 case of Schloendorff v Society of New York Hospital was the final landmark case that legally established the principle of patient autonomy. The plaintiff, Mary Schloendorff, explicitly stated her wish not to undergo surgery yet was subjected to hysterectomy to remove a fibroid tumor without her consent.

In the ruling, Judge Benjamin Cardozo wrote, ‚ÄúEvery human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages. Notably, these landmark cases that established the legal precedent of patient autonomy all had female plaintiffs at a time when women did not have the right to vote in the United States, indelibly intertwining the right of patient autonomy with the right of a woman to consent to procedures on her own body.

Nevertheless, the principle of ‚Äúinformed consent‚Äù remained nameless and not legally binding until the term was first publicly recorded in the court documents for the 1957 case Salgo v Leland Stanford Jr University Board of Trustees. The plaintiff in the case, Mr Martin Salgo, had arteriosclerosis of the aorta and underwent a translumbar procedure to evaluate its extent. During the procedure, a contrast agent was injected into his aorta to identify blockages, and the procedure resulted in permanent paralysis of his lower limbs. Mr Salgo sued the university medical center and its chief surgeon for lack of disclosure of this potential risk. In a California appellate court decision, the court directed that each physician must exercise practical insight in completely divulging potential procedural hazards and that physicians are liable for failing to disclose information that a patient would need to make an informed decision regarding medical procedures. This legal ruling was the first to identify and focus attention on the need to provide the patient with information about the potential benefits and the risks of any medical procedure

While these cases established the legal framework for and the principle of informed consent, as well as the duty of physicians to obtain informed consent for diagnostic and/or therapeutic medical procedures, the concept of informed consent in human subjects research began to emerge in parallel as a consequence of the investigation of Nazi war crimes at the end of World War II. On August 20, 1947, the trial of 23 physicians and bureaucrats charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes for medical experiments conducted on concentration camp inmates concluded in Nuremberg, Germany

The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male (informally referred to as the Tuskegee Experiment or Tuskegee Syphilis Study) was a study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African American men with syphilis. The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study medical advancements meant it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment, and more than 100 died as a result. 

The men were initially told that the experiment was only going to last six months, but it was extended to 40 years. After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the infected men were treated with penicillin despite the fact that, by 1947, the antibiotic was widely available and had become the standard treatment for syphilis. The study continued, under numerous Public Health Service supervisors, until 1972, when a leak to the press resulted in its termination on November 16 of that year

n 1974, Congress passed the National Research Act and created a commission to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials and drafting of Belmont report.

Informed Consent in Clinical Practice (Part 1)

Informed consent is a process that‚Äôs required for most medical procedures. However, there‚Äôs often confusion about what informed consent is, what it means, and when it‚Äôs needed. In a healthcare setting, informed consent allows you to participate in your own medical care. It enables you to decide which treatments you do or do not want to receive. Also, informed consent allows you to make decisions with your healthcare provider. This collaborative decision-making process is an ethical and legal obligation of healthcare providers.


The significance of informed consent lies in its ethical foundation and its role in upholding the principle of respect for persons. By obtaining informed consent, healthcare professionals, researchers, and practitioners acknowledge and honor the autonomy of individuals. This ethical framework fosters trust between the provider and the recipient of care or participant in research. Moreover, it promotes patient-centered care and empowers individuals to actively engage in decisions about their health and well-being.


Informed consent is when a healthcare provider ‚Äî like a doctor, nurse, or other healthcare professional ‚Äî explains a medical treatment to a patient before the patient agrees to it. This type of communication lets the patient ask questions and accept or deny treatment.

In a healthcare setting, the process of informed consent includes:
- your ability to make a decision
- explanation of information needed to make the decision
- your understanding of the medical information
- your voluntary decision to get treatment

These components are essential elements of the shared decision-making process between you and your healthcare provider. Most importantly, it empowers you to make educated and informed decisions about your health and medical care.


When a healthcare provider recommends a specific procedure, you have the right to accept or refuse it. If you decide to move forward, you‚Äôll need to give informed consent first. Informed consent means that you made a voluntary and educated decision. It also means that your healthcare provider has fully explained the medical procedure, including its risks and benefits. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns about this process. As the patient, you have the right to make informed choices about your medical care and what works best for you.


Despite its critical importance, obtaining informed consent can pose challenges. Communication barriers, cultural differences, and varying levels of health literacy may hinder the disclosure and comprehension of information. In some cases, power imbalances between healthcare providers and patients or researchers and participants can compromise the voluntariness of consent. Striking a balance between providing adequate information and avoiding information overload is another delicate aspect of the informed consent process.

In conclusion, informed consent stands as a pivotal ethical principle in healthcare, research, and various professional contexts. Its components‚Äîdisclosure, comprehension, voluntariness, and competence‚Äîwork synergistically to uphold individual autonomy and ensure ethical practice. The significance of informed consent resonates in its role in fostering trust, patient empowerment, and the protection of individuals involved in healthcare and research. While challenges may arise in the consent process, continued efforts to enhance communication, respect cultural nuances, and address power differentials contribute to the ethical foundation of informed consent

Psychotherapy Documentation (Part 1) Basics of Psychotherapy Documentation and Record Keeping


Medical records form an integral part of patient care. Proper documentation and its maintenance are mandatory as part of the law. It is essential for a treating doctor to document the required details to avoid allegations of negligence. Proper documentation will not only help us to prove that particular services were provided but can also serve as a tool for communication with other professionals. This video focuses and draws together the standards and suggests some good clinical practices as per the Mental Healthcare Act 2017.

Documentation in psychotherapy typically includes client intake forms, informed consent, treatment plans, progress notes, and discharge summaries. It's crucial to maintain detailed and confidential records to track the client's progress and ensure ethical and legal standards are met.

Tarasoff Rule (Tarasoff 1 & Tarasoff 2) Duty warn and Duty to Protect

The Tarasoff case, officially Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California (1976), is a landmark legal case in the United States that set the precedent for the duty of mental health professionals to protect potential victims of their patients.

In 1969, Prosenjit Poddar, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, began therapy at the university's student health services. His therapist learned during sessions that Poddar had intentions of harming Tatiana Tarasoff. Despite efforts to warn the campus police and have Poddar detained, he was released. 

Tragically, Poddar later carried out his threat and killed Tatiana Tarasoff.

The lawsuit filed by the Tarasoff family alleged that the university and the therapists failed to warn Tatiana or her family about the danger she faced. The California Supreme Court, in its decision, established the duty of mental health professionals to warn potential victims or take reasonable steps to protect them from foreseeable harm. This duty has since become a crucial aspect of mental health law, influencing similar legal standards in other jurisdictions.

The Tarasoff rules, also known as Tarasoff I and Tarasoff II, pertain to the duty of mental health professionals to warn and protect potential victims when a patient poses a serious threat. Tarasoff I established the duty to warn, while Tarasoff II expanded it to include the duty to protect, meaning taking steps to prevent harm. These rules originated from a legal case (Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California) and vary by jurisdiction, but generally emphasize the importance of balancing patient confidentiality with the protection of potential victims from foreseeable harm.

Treatment Gap in Mental Illness [Treatment Gap in Psychiatric Illness]

The treatment gap in psychiatric illness refers to the disparity between the number of individuals who need mental health treatment and the number who actually receive it. As per NMHS 2015-16 study, treatment gap is 70 to 80% in various mental disorders. 


This gap exists for various reasons and can have significant implications for public health. Here are some key factors contributing to the treatment gap in psychiatric illness:

Stigma: Stigma surrounding mental health issues can prevent individuals from seeking help or disclosing their symptoms. Many people fear being judged or discriminated against if they reveal that they have a psychiatric condition.

Lack of Awareness: Some individuals may not recognize the signs and symptoms of mental illness, leading to delayed or no treatment seeking. This lack of awareness can be compounded by cultural and societal factors.

Access to Services: In many regions, access to mental health services can be limited, especially in rural areas or low-income communities. The shortage of mental health professionals, long wait times, and financial barriers can all contribute to the treatment gap.

Cost: Mental health care can be expensive, and many people do not have insurance coverage for it. Even when insurance does cover mental health services, high deductibles and copayments can be a barrier to care.

Underdiagnosis and Misdiagnosis: Some psychiatric conditions go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed as other medical or psychological problems. This can lead to inappropriate or ineffective treatment.

Shortages of Mental Health Professionals: There is a shortage of mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, in many areas. This shortage can result in long waiting times for treatment.

Fragmented Care: In some cases, individuals with psychiatric illnesses receive care from multiple providers without adequate coordination. This can lead to gaps in treatment and an inefficient use of resources.

Reliance on Self-Medication: Some individuals with mental health issues turn to self-medication with drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with their symptoms, further complicating their conditions.

Cultural and Language Barriers: Cultural and language differences can create barriers to accessing appropriate mental health care, as some individuals may not find services that are sensitive to their cultural or linguistic needs.

Mental Health Policy and Funding: Inadequate funding for mental health services and insufficient policy support can contribute to the treatment gap, making it difficult to provide adequate care for those in need.

Reducing the treatment gap in psychiatric illness involves addressing these and other factors. Strategies may include public education and awareness campaigns, improving access to mental health services, increasing the number of mental health professionals, reducing stigma, and implementing mental health policies that prioritize early intervention and effective treatment. It is crucial to recognize the importance of mental health and work to ensure that individuals with psychiatric illnesses can access the care they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.

Course and outcome of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [Impact of ADHD] Economic Burden of ADHD

Earlier. ADHD was concerned as a typical childhood disorder. Long-term studies though, showed that an 5-76% percentage of children with ADHD grew as adults with ADHD. 


Although commonly diagnosed in childhood, ADHD can persist into adolescence and adulthood and adversely affect functional outcomes. Academic difficulties are a common problem in ADHD and are often the reason for a child‚Äôs initial referral for clinical evaluation

An 8-year longitudinal study showed that ADHD diagnosis at 4 to 6 years of age predicted lower reading, spelling, and math standardized achievement test scores in adolescence after controlling for IQ (Massetti et al., 2008). Children diagnosed with Inattentive Type ADHD in childhood had lower achievement scores in adolescence compared with either children diagnosed with Combined Type ADHD or control comparison children (Massetti et al., 2008). On average, children with ADHD earn lower grades compared with peers (Frazier et al., 2007). 

Most children with this condition continue with its symptoms into adulthood. 80% of the children who require medication for ADHD will need them as teenagers. Over 50% need medication as adults.

If left untreated, ADHD can gravely interfere with the social and educational performance of an individual and may impair the individual's self-esteem. They may be looked down on as trouble makers or slow learners at school and invariably be treated as out casts. Most of them have failed relationships with colleagues or peers. They may have strained relationship with parents and siblings too.

25-30% of ADHD children with conduct disorder problem develop antisocial personality disorder and become victims of substance abuse, criminal behavior. Being prone to depression and anxiety, they have suicidal tendencies too.

 Social and emotional adjustment problems may be persistent. Poor acceptance by peers and loneliness tend to increase with age and with the obvious display of symptoms. Substance abuse may result if ADHD is not identified and adequately treated because many adolescents and adults with ADHD self-medicate with both legal (eg, caffeine) and illegal (eg, cocaine, amphetamines) substances.

Although hyperactivity symptoms and signs tend to diminish with age, adolescents and adults may display residual difficulties. Predictors of adult ADHD include
- Severe ADHD 
- comorbid ODD / conduct disorder
- Comorbid depression
- Poor compliance to treatment 

To conclude - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists into adulthood. Studies have found that a majority of people diagnosed with ADHD in childhood continue to meet criteria for the disorder as adults. More recent studies have found that a substantial proportion of those with adult ADHD did not have the condition in childhood. ADHD in adulthood is associated with significant impairment in occupational, academic, and social functioning

Description of video 91:
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adult [ Adult ADHD] ADHD in Adults

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) historically was considered to be a disease of childhood, affecting 5 to 6 percent of school age children.

It is now well established that ADHD symptoms persist into adult life in 50 to 60 percent of cases. 

The prevalence of Adult ADHD is 2 to 2.5 percent of adults

ADHD is not an acquired disorder of adult life. To qualify for ADHD as an adult, one must have had it as a child, although some of the symptoms of ADHD can occur in adults due to brain injuries or other organic causes. Symptoms are present consistently since childhood, and do not occur episodically.

Adults commonly complain of impairment in work and at home and in relationships with other people due to impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and difficulty paying attention. They often have an associated psychiatric disorder, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, or a learning disability

Untreated or under-treated adult ADHD may result in impaired occupational functioning and interpersonal and legal difficulties. ADHD in adults is associated with higher separation and divorce rates and more frequent job changes

Signs and Symptoms of Adult ADHD

Difficulty getting started on tasks
Variable attention to details
Difficulties with self-organization and with prioritization
Poor persistence in tasks that require sustained mental effort
Impulsivity and low frustration tolerance (to varying degrees)
Hyperactivity (less salient symptom in adults)
Chaotic life-styles
Associated psychiatric comorbidities (in some patients)
Disorganization
Substance abuse (in some patients)

There are no laboratory studies currently available to diagnose adult ADHD. However, the psychiatrist should monitor liver function studies and a CBC (complete blood count) both prior to initiation of treatment with medication and serially thereafter. Hyperthyroidism should be ruled out.

Treatment Methods of Adult ADHD
Stimulants alone
Stimulants with other psychotropic medication
Nonstimulant psychotherapeutic medications alone
Supportive psychotherapy
Behavioral interventions/psychotherapy

The purpose of medications used in the treatment of adult ADHD is to obtain enhanced attention, better academic performance, and facilitated working memory. Medications also can reduce psychomotor activity, decrease aggression, and decrease disruptive behavior.

ADHD is now understood to be a disorder that persists into adulthood in some persons and has global effects on their daily lives, affecting social, occupational, and relational functioning. Evidence-based pharmacologic, psychosocial, and psychotherapeutic interventions are available for effective treatment

Description of video 92:
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Part 2 [Assessment, Treatment and Outcome]

Treating ADHD often requires medical, educational, behavioral and psychological intervention. This comprehensive approach to treatment is sometimes called ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù and, depending on the age of the individual with ADHD, may include:

parent training
medication
skills training
counseling
behavioral therapy
educational supports
education regarding ADHD

Working closely with health care providers and other professionals, treatment should be tailored to the unique needs of each individual and family to help the patient control symptoms, cope with the disorder, improve overall psychological well-being and manage social relationships.

A comprehensive treatment plan can include all or some of the following based on the unique needs of your child, available resources and prioritization of need:

Medications 

Medication can be an important part of ADHD treatment. It can help to control symptoms, helping a child stay on task and pay attention. It can only be prescribed by medical professionals, not other professionals. An accurate ADHD diagnosis is needed, including an evaluation for other possible diagnoses, before medication is prescribed.

Each family must consider the benefits and drawbacks of medication when deciding how to treat their child‚Äôs ADHD symptoms. Medication does not cure ADHD. It eases ADHD symptoms during the time it is active. 

There are 5 types of medicine licensed for the treatment of ADHD:

methylphenidate
lisdexamfetamine
dexamfetamine
atomoxetine
guanfacine
These medicines are not a permanent cure for ADHD but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills.

Some medicines need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended to assess whether the medicine is still needed.

Nonstimulant medications may be used when stimulants do not work well, have unacceptable side effects, or a nonstimulant is preferred for other reasons. They do not work as quickly as stimulants and for most individuals not as well. Side effects can include nervousness, sleep problems, fatigue, upset stomach, dizziness, or a dry mouth. For some they work better, and once built up in the system the effect is smoother over time.

Therapy
As well as taking medicine, different therapies can be useful in treating ADHD in children, teenagers and adults. Therapy is also effective in treating additional problems, such as conduct or anxiety disorders, that may appear with ADHD.

Here are some of the therapies that may be used.

Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation means you or your child will be encouraged to discuss ADHD and its effects. It can help children, teenagers and adults make sense of being diagnosed with ADHD, and can help you to cope and live with the condition.

Behaviour therapy
Behaviour therapy provides support for carers of children with ADHD and may involve teachers as well as parents. Behaviour therapy usually involves behaviour management, which uses a system of rewards to encourage your child to try to control their ADHD.

If your child has ADHD, you can identify types of behaviour you want to encourage, such as sitting at the table to eat. Your child is then given some sort of small reward for good behaviour.

For teachers, behaviour management involves learning how to plan and structure activities, and to praise and encourage children for even very small amounts of progress.

Parent training and education programmes
If your child has ADHD, specially tailored parent training and education programmes can help you learn specific ways of talking to your child, and playing and working with them to improve their attention and behaviour.

You may also be offered parent training before your child is formally diagnosed with ADHD.

These programmes are usually arranged in groups of around 10 to 12 parents. A programme usually consists of 10 to 16 meetings, lasting up to 2 hours each.

Being offered a parent training and education programme does not mean you have been a bad parent ‚Äì it aims to teach parents and carers about behaviour management, while increasing confidence in your ability to help your child and improve your relationship.

Social skills training
Social skills training involves your child taking part in role-play situations and aims to teach them how to behave in social situations by learning how their behaviour affects others.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. A therapist would try to change how you or your child feels about a situation, which would in turn potentially change their behaviour.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Part 1 [Diagnosis, Prevalence, and Neurobiology] 

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.

Signs and Symptoms - It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.

A child with ADHD might:

daydream a lot
forget or lose things a lot
squirm or fidget
talk too much
make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks
have a hard time resisting temptation
have trouble taking turns
have difficulty getting along with others

Types
There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:

1. Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: It is hard for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.

2. Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may run, jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and injuries than others.

3. Combined Presentation: Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the person.
Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over time as well.

Causes of ADHD

Scientists are studying cause(s) and risk factors in an effort to find better ways to manage and reduce the chances of a person having ADHD. The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but current research shows that genetics plays an important role. Recent studies link genetic factors with ADHD.1

In addition to genetics, scientists are studying other possible causes and risk factors including:

Brain injury
Exposure to environmental risks (e.g., lead) during pregnancy or at a young age
Alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy
Premature delivery

Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused by eating too much sugar, watching too much television, parenting, or social and environmental factors such as poverty or family chaos. Of course, many things, including these, might make symptoms worse, especially in certain people. But the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that they are the main causes of ADHD.

Diagnosis of ADHD as per DSM V 

Typically, ADHD symptoms arise in early childhood. According to the DSM-5, several symptoms are required to be present before the age of 12. Many parents report excessive motor activity during the toddler years, but ADHD symptoms can be hard to distinguish from the impulsivity, inattentiveness and active behavior that is typical for kids under the age of four. In making the diagnosis, children should have six or more symptoms of the disorder present; adolescents 17 and older and adults should have at least five of the symptoms present. The DSM-5 lists three presentations of ADHD‚ÄîPredominantly Inattentive, Hyperactive-Impulsive and Combined. 

1. ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation

Fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes
Has difficulty sustaining attention
Does not appear to listen
Struggles to follow through with instructions
Has difficulty with organization
Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort
Loses things
Is easily distracted
Is forgetful in daily activities



2. ADHD predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation

Fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in chair
Has difficulty remaining seated
Runs about or climbs excessively in children; extreme restlessness in adults
Difficulty engaging in activities quietly
Acts as if driven by a motor; adults will often feel inside as if they are driven by a motor
Talks excessively
Blurts out answers before questions have been completed
Difficulty waiting or taking turns
Interrupts or intrudes upon others

ADHD combined presentation

The individual meets the criteria for both inattention and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD presentations.

Attempted Suicide and Legal Issues  (Medicolegal issues regarding attempted suicide)

Attempted suicide is a serious problem requiring mental health interventions, but it continues to be treated as a criminal offence under the section 309 of Indian Penal Code.

The IPC Sec 309 states that "Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved in any case to have extreme pressure and will not be attempted and rebuffed under the said Code"

Section 115(1) of the Mental Healthcare Act 2017 says that any person who attempts suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the code. The Act regards a person who attempts suicide as a victim of circumstances and not an offender. 

Now As per the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 in any attempted suicide case government will have to provide rehabilitation, care, therapy and treatment to the person who was trying to commit suicide to reduce the risk of recurrence of the same incident.

The cost of rehabilitation and treatment would be free for the person in any government funded mental health institution. The Mental Healthcare Act of 2017 has bought in a paradigm shift from punishment to care, treatment and rehabilitation of persons with attempted suicide 

Decriminalizing suicide is not enough. There is a need for a comprehensive health program to reduce its incidence. Furthermore, the stigma attached with suicides will only recede if the government and the social sector take a proactive role in spreading anti-suicide awareness. Finally, law can never be the entire answer. Hence, framing laws and getting them perfect should not take up all our time. There is a need to build the political will to implement these laws. Suicide attempt is thus a multidimensional problem having legal, social and psychological implications. Hence, teamwork is required to assess and tackle this problem.

Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder [OCPD]

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of rigid perfectionism, excessive attention to details, and an overwhelming need for control over one's environment and interpersonal relationships. It is important to note that OCPD is distinct from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is an anxiety disorder.

Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Perfectionism: They have an excessive preoccupation with orderliness, details, and rules. They set high standards for themselves and others, often to the point of being excessively critical.

2. Excessive devotion to work: They are driven by a strong need for productivity and often prioritize work above leisure activities or personal relationships. They may struggle to delegate tasks and have difficulty accepting help from others.

3. Inflexibility and need for control: Individuals with OCPD tend to be rigid in their thinking and have a strong need for control over their environment and others. They may have difficulty adapting to changes or new situations and may be resistant to alternative viewpoints or suggestions.

4. Preoccupation with rules and lists: They may excessively adhere to rules, regulations, and schedules. They may create detailed lists and routines and become distressed if they are unable to follow them.

5. Difficulty with decision-making: Due to their perfectionism and fear of making mistakes, individuals with OCPD may have difficulty making decisions. They may spend an excessive amount of time analyzing options and seeking reassurance.

6. Lack of spontaneity: People with OCPD often have difficulty being spontaneous or taking risks. They prefer predictability and may resist engaging in activities that do not fit within their established routines or plans.

7. Interpersonal difficulties: They may struggle with forming close relationships due to their high standards, need for control, and difficulties in expressing emotions. They may be seen as cold or emotionally detached by others.

It's important to note that while OCPD can cause significant distress and impairment in functioning, individuals with this disorder often do not perceive their behavior as problematic and may resist seeking treatment. However, therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy, can be helpful in addressing maladaptive patterns, reducing rigidity, and improving overall well-being.

If you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of OCPD, it is recommended to consult with a mental health professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.

Principles to be followed in Treatment of Depression in Pregnancy

Prevalence of depression during pregnancy ranges from 4% to 20%. Several risk factors predispose to depression during pregnancy including obstetric factors. Depression during pregnancy is not only the strongest risk factor for post-natal depression but also leads to adverse obstetric outcomes.

Depression during pregnancy is a matter of public health importance due to 3 prime reasons: 

Firstly, rate of depression during pregnancy is high during antenatal period. 

Secondly, it is the strongest risk factor for post-natal depression.

Thirdly, it leads to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, makes depression during pregnancy a matter of great importance.

Women who currently suffer major depression and are treated with pharmacotherapy may present with an unplanned pregnancy, in which case the fetus has been exposed to the antidepressant. For these patients, it is suggested that they continue their antidepressant, especially if the depressive episode has been severe (eg, marked by suicide attempts, psychotic features, or functional incapacitation). However, if the depressive syndrome has been mild to moderate and the patient feels strongly about avoiding further exposure, pharmacotherapy can be discontinued for the first trimester (during organogenesis), and subsequently restarted. In addition, it is reasonable to switch the patient from pharmacotherapy to psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy), while monitoring for deterioration. A gradual (eg, at least over one to two weeks) taper of antidepressants is preferred to avoid worsening of the depressive syndrome; patients may nevertheless insist upon abruptly stopping the drug due to concerns about teratogenicity.

Unplanned pregnancy may also arise in women who are currently euthymic and treated with antidepressants; these patients need to decide whether to continue treatment. The factors involved include the risks of recurrence and maternal depression, as well as the risks of using antidepressants during pregnancy.

Some of the principles are 

Start low and go slow on medication
Avoid switching medicines 
Do not stop medicine during child birth 
Minimal effective dosage should be advised 
Advocate psychotherapy
Combination of treatment is required in severe cases

Thirdly, it leads to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Thus, makes depression during pregnancy a matter of great importance.

Many women with postnatal depression can be managed, at least initially, without medication. Unless the woman has very significant or long-standing severe symptoms, it is worth starting with psychosocial management. Antidepressants can be mentioned as one possibility if things do not improve. Although trials have been limited in postnatal depression, evidence suggests that antidepressants do have a role in treatment.

Indications for use of antidepressants for perinatal depression

Severe or significant number of symptoms, particularly biological symptoms (e.g. sleep and appetite disturbance), Persistent symptoms, Response to psychosocial management nil or inadequate, Unable to offer psychosocial management because of cost, distance, or other practical factors, Family or past history of good response to medication and Woman's preference

Interventions for depression during pregnancy typically involve a combination of therapeutic approaches. Here are some common interventions and strategies:

Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy, is often a first-line intervention for depression during pregnancy. It provides a safe and effective way to address depressive symptoms and develop coping strategies.

Medication: In cases of severe depression or when psychotherapy alone is insufficient, healthcare providers may consider antidepressant medication. The choice of medication should be carefully considered, and the potential risks and benefits discussed with the patient.

Lifestyle Changes: Encouraging pregnant individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle can help manage depressive symptoms. This includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques.

Monitoring and Follow-Up: Regular check-ins with healthcare providers are essential to monitor progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.

Education: Providing pregnant individuals with information about depression during pregnancy, its impact, and available treatment options can help them make informed decisions about their care.

It's important to emphasize that the treatment plan should be tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the individual. The goal is to address depression while minimizing potential risks to the developing fetus. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider to discuss the most appropriate interventions for your situation.

Postpartum Depression (Postnatal Depression) Perinatal Depression

About two to three days after giving birth, feelings of depression and anxiety are common. Mother may experience crying for no reason, having trouble sleeping or questioning their ability to care for your new baby. Women with postpartum depression have intense feelings of sadness, anxiety, or despair that prevent them from being able to do their daily tasks. Following are the symptoms of Postpartum depression

A loss of pleasure or interest in things you used to enjoy, including sex

Eating much more, or much less, than you usually do

Anxiety‚Äîall or most of the time‚Äîor panic attacks

Racing, scary thoughts

Feeling guilty or worthless‚Äîblaming yourself

Excessive irritability, anger, or agitation‚Äîmood swings

Sadness, crying uncontrollably for very long periods of time

Fear of not being a good mother

Fear of being left alone with the baby

Inability to sleep, sleeping too much, difficulty falling or staying asleep

Disinterest in the baby, family, and friends

Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, or making decisions

Thoughts of hurting yourself or the baby (see below for numbers to call to get immediate help).

If these warning signs or symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, you may need to get help. Whether your symptoms are mild or severe, recovery is possible with proper treatment.

Postpartum depression can be treated with medications called antidepressants. Talk therapy also is used to treat depression, often in combination with medications.

Antidepressants are medications that work to balance the chemicals in the brain that control moods. There are many types of antidepressants. Drugs sometimes are combined when needed to get the best results. It may take 3‚Äì4 weeks of taking the medication before you start to feel better. If a woman takes antidepressants, they can be transferred to her baby during breastfeeding. The levels found in breast milk generally are very low. Breastfeeding has many benefits for both you and your baby. Deciding to take an antidepressant while breastfeeding involves weighing these benefits against the potential risks of your baby being exposed to the medication in your breast milk. It is best to discuss this decision with your ob-gyn or other health care professional.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) Dysmorphophobia

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental illness. People who have this illness constantly worry about the way they look. They may believe an inconspicuous or non-existent physical attribute is a serious defect. They respond to this by performing repetitive acts such as mirror checking or comparing their appearance with others.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), also known as dysmorphophobia, is a severe psychiatric disorder that occurs around the world.

Individuals with BDD obsess that there is something wrong with how they look, even though the perceived appearance flaw is actually minimal or nonexistent. They may describe themselves as looking unattractive or deformed, or even hideous or like a monster. Concerns most often focus on the face or head (e.g., acne or skin color, balding, or head size) but can include any body area or the entire body, and concern with multiple body areas is typical. The appearance preoccupations are difficult to resist or control, and on average consume 3 to 8 hours a day. They are often associated with fears of rejection and feelings of low self-esteem, shame, embarrassment, unworthiness, and being unlovable. Insight is usually poor, and nearly half of patients are delusional (i.e., completely certain that they look abnormal and that their view of the 'defect' is accurate). In addition, a majority have ideas or delusions of reference, thinking that others take special notice of the 'defect', perhaps staring at it, talking about it, or mocking it.

Symptoms can vary according to which body part (or parts) is targeted, but general symptoms of BDD include:

- thinking about the perceived defect for hours every day 

- worrying about their failure to match the ‚Äòphysical perfection‚Äô of models and celebrities

- distress about their preoccupation

- constantly asking trusted loved ones for reassurance about their looks, but not believing the answer

- constantly looking at their reflection or taking pains to avoid catching their reflection (for example, throwing away or covering up mirrors)

- grooming to excess ‚Äì for example, shaving the same patch of skin over and over avoiding any situation they feel will call attention to their defect. 

In extreme cases, this can mean never leaving home
taking great pains to hide or camouflage the ‚Äòdefect‚Äô
squeezing or picking at skin blemishes for hours on end
wanting dermatological treatment or cosmetic surgery, even when professionals believe the treatment is unnecessary repeat cosmetic surgery procedures, especially if the same body part is being ‚Äòimproved‚Äô with each procedure depression and anxiety, including suicidal thoughts.

Treatment for BDD

BDD is not always easy to treat but the treatments that seem to help the most include a combination of:

Medication ‚Äì including antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medications help reduce many BDD symptoms, including the compulsive thoughts, depression and anxiety. Generally, medications are used in combination with psychotherapy.


Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) ‚Äì training in how to change underlying attitudes in order to think and feel in different ways. This includes learning to tolerate the distress of ‚Äòexposing‚Äô their perceived defect to others and in not performing rituals related to appearance concerns.


Some people with body dysmorphic disorder seek cosmetic surgery to ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô an actual or perceived physical flaw. Medical experts are divided on the ethics of performing cosmetic surgery under these circumstances (sometimes called ‚Äònon-therapeutic mutilation‚Äô or extreme body modification).

Any medical or surgical procedure carries health risks. Unnecessary attempts to change appearance through surgery may lead to dissatisfaction with the results and could worsen a person‚Äôs BBD.

Hypochondriasis [ Illness anxiety disorder ] Health anxiety disorder  [Fear of having illness]

Hypochondriasis is a fear of having serious dreadful illness. In simple words it is characterized by excessive fear of or preoccupation with a serious illness, despite medical testing and reassurance to the contrary.

Hypochondriasis is a disabling and exhausting psychiatric disorder, which can be characterized by unexplainable beliefs and a fear of having a lethal disease. Individuals with hypochondriasis typically would check for health-related information online frequently, which is regarded as the major cause leading to the occurrence and development of hypochondriasis

Recent surveys revealed a growing proportion of individuals affected by hypochondriasis ranging from 3.4% in the Australian population

It usually starts in early adulthood and may show up after the person or someone they know has gone through an illness or after they‚Äôve lost someone to a serious medical condition. About two-thirds of hypochondriacs have a co-existing psychiatric disorder, such as panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or major depression. Hypochondria symptoms can vary, depending on factors such as stress, age, and whether the person is already an extreme worrier.


Hypochondriac symptoms may include:

- Regularly checking themselves for any sign of illness
- Fearing that anything from a runny nose to a gurgle in their gut is the sign of a serious illness
- Making frequent visits to their doctor
- Conversely, avoiding the doctor due to fear that the doctor will find they have a dreaded disease or serious illness
- Talking excessively about their health
- Spending a lot of time online, researching their symptoms
- May focus on just one thing: a certain disease (example: cancer) or a certain body part (example: the lungs if they cough). Or, they may fear any disease or might become focused on a trending disease (example: during flu season, they may be convinced that a sniffle means they‚Äôre coming down with the flu)
- Are unconvinced that their negative medical tests are correct, then worry that they have something undiagnosed and that no one will be able to find it and cure them
- Avoiding people or places they fear may cause them to get sick

Health anxiety can actually have its own symptoms because it‚Äôs possible for the person to have stomachaches, dizziness, or pain as a result of their overwhelming anxiety. In fact, illness anxiety can take over a hypochondriac‚Äôs life to the point that worrying and living in fear are so stressful, the person can become debilitated.

You may be wondering what triggers hypochondria. Although there really isn‚Äôt an exact cause, we do know that people with illness anxiety are more likely to have a family member who is also a hypochondriac. The person with health anxiety may have gone through a serious illness and fear that their bad experience may be repeated. They may be going through major life stress or have had a serious illness during childhood. Or, they may already be suffering from a mental health condition and their hypochondria may be part of it.


Given the nature of somatic symptoms and obsessive fears of medical diseases, patients with hypochondriasis will repeatedly present to primary care and specialty physicians. 

The exact causes of hypchondriasis remain unclear but most likely involve multifactorial etiologies including psychological, social and neurobiological origins. Successful management of hypochondriasis begins with the establishment of a solid therapeutic alliance. Throughout the treatment process, use of reassurances, further investigations and specific treatments must be carefully selected. An appreciation for the continuum of hypochondriasis from excessive health concern to psychosis can also help guide treatment. Judicious use of reassurance could be helpful in the elderly and those who have suffered life-threatening diseases such as malignancies. However, antipsychotics might be considered in those with hypochondriacal psychosis. For most
patients, antidepressants, CBT and other psychotherapies have been shown to be effective. Collaboration with and referral to mental health
professionals are additional options. Again, the patient‚Äìphysician alliance should be utilized to guide therapy

Anxious Avoidant Personality Disorder [Anxious Avoidant PD]

Anxious-avoidant personality disorder, also known as avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Here are some common features associated with anxious-avoidant personality disorder:

1. Avoidance of social interactions: Individuals with AvPD often experience intense anxiety and fear in social situations. They tend to avoid social interactions and may isolate themselves to minimize the possibility of criticism, rejection, or embarrassment.

2. Hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection: People with AvPD are highly sensitive to perceived criticism or rejection from others. They may interpret neutral or benign comments as negative and respond with feelings of hurt, anger, or humiliation.

3. Feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem: They frequently have a pervasive sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem. They may believe they are unworthy of attention, affection, or positive regard from others.

4. Reluctance to take risks: Individuals with AvPD tend to be risk-averse and may avoid new experiences or challenges due to fear of failure or embarrassment. They may prefer routine and familiar environments where they feel more secure.

5. Difficulty in forming close relationships: People with AvPD often struggle to form and maintain close relationships. They may have a deep longing for connection but simultaneously fear rejection and intimacy. Trusting others and sharing personal feelings can be particularly challenging for them.

6. Preoccupation with negative evaluation: They may be preoccupied with negative thoughts about how others perceive them. They may engage in excessive self-criticism and worry excessively about being judged or criticized by others.

7. Avoidance of occupational or educational activities: Individuals with AvPD may avoid occupational or educational activities that involve significant interpersonal interaction. They may choose jobs or educational paths that allow for minimal social interaction or require minimal exposure to evaluation or criticism.

Treatment for anxious-avoidant personality disorder typically involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy. The goals of therapy may include:

1. Building self-esteem and self-acceptance: Helping individuals with AvPD develop a more positive self-image, challenge negative self-perceptions, and improve self-acceptance.

2. Addressing avoidance behaviors: Gradually exposing individuals to feared social situations and teaching them coping skills to manage anxiety and discomfort in social interactions.

3. Cognitive restructuring: Identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and distorted beliefs about oneself and others. Developing more realistic and balanced thinking can help individuals reframe their perceptions of social situations.

4. Interpersonal skills training: Teaching individuals effective communication skills, assertiveness, and boundary-setting techniques to improve their ability to form and maintain healthy relationships.

5. Anxiety management techniques: Providing strategies for managing anxiety symptoms, such as relaxation techniques, mindfulness, and stress reduction strategies.

It's important to note that treatment for anxious-avoidant personality disorder can be a long-term process, and progress may be gradual. It's crucial to work with a mental health professional experienced in treating personality disorders to develop an individualized treatment plan. With appropriate support and therapy, individuals with AvPD can learn to manage their anxiety, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and improve their overall quality of life.

Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)

Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Here are some common features associated with antisocial personality disorder:

1. Lack of empathy and remorse: Individuals with ASPD have difficulty empathizing with others and tend to disregard the feelings, rights, and well-being of others. They may show little to no remorse for their actions, even when they cause harm to others.

2. Persistent disregard for societal norms: People with ASPD often display a pattern of behavior that goes against societal rules and norms. This may include engaging in illegal activities, deceitfulness, impulsivity, and a disregard for the safety and rights of others.

3. Manipulative and deceitful behavior: They frequently engage in manipulative and deceitful tactics to exploit others for personal gain or pleasure. They may lie, deceive, or manipulate others to achieve their goals without regard for the consequences.

4. Lack of responsibility and accountability: Individuals with ASPD often have difficulty taking responsibility for their actions and may try to shift blame onto others. They may display a sense of entitlement and believe that rules and obligations do not apply to them.

5. Impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors: They may engage in impulsive and reckless behaviors, such as substance abuse, reckless driving, or engaging in dangerous activities without consideration for their own safety or the safety of others.

6. Lack of long-term goals or stability: People with ASPD often have difficulty establishing and maintaining stable relationships, employment, or consistent life goals. They may have a history of unstable jobs, frequent relationship problems, and a lack of long-term planning.

7. Early onset of behavioral problems: The symptoms of ASPD typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, and there is often a history of conduct disorder during childhood characterized by aggression, rule violations, and disregard for others' rights.

It's important to note that individuals with ASPD may not seek treatment willingly or recognize the need for treatment. The primary mode of treatment for ASPD is psychotherapy, although it can be challenging due to the individual's resistance to change and lack of motivation. The goals of therapy may include:

1. Encouraging accountability and responsibility: Therapy aims to help individuals with ASPD take responsibility for their actions, understand the impact of their behaviors on others, and develop a sense of accountability.

2. Developing empathy and prosocial behaviors: Therapeutic interventions can focus on developing empathy and promoting the understanding of the emotions and experiences of others. This may involve teaching skills for healthy relationships, communication, and conflict resolution.

3. Addressing comorbid conditions: Individuals with ASPD may also experience other mental health conditions, such as substance use disorders or depression. Treating these comorbid conditions can improve overall well-being and increase the chances of successful treatment outcomes.

4. Enhancing problem-solving and coping skills: Therapy can help individuals with ASPD develop healthier problem-solving and coping strategies, which can reduce impulsive and risk-taking behaviors.

It's essential to work with a mental health professional experienced in treating personality disorders and conduct disorders when dealing with antisocial personality disorder. The treatment approach should be tailored to the individual's specific needs and may require a multidisciplinary approach involving therapists, psychiatrists, and other healthcare professionals.

Supreme Court - Human Rights of Persons with Mental Illness

Mental hospitals in India, as elsewhere in the world, have played an important role in the care of persons with mental illness. Since their inception, they have both been decried for gross violations of human rights and dignity as well as lauded as places of refuge and care for persons turned away by the communities. In a country where community interventions for mental health care are still fragmentary, the mental hospital still continues to be a relevant and legitimate locus of care along with other limited resources available for the care of persons with mental illness outside of the family. In India, positive changes in the infrastructure and resourcing of mental hospitals, reductions in involuntary admissions, and improvements in facilities have largely occurred through judicial interventions. Recent pilot interventions for the rehabilitation of long-stay patients point towards the need to develop rehabilitation and community facilities for persons with severe mental illness.

Judicial intervention in mental health can be traced back initially as responses to public interest litigation (PIL) to the Supreme Court of India that occurred over the last three decades. The first of these can be traced back to the 1980s, and concerned the ‚Äòinhuman treatment of inmates‚Äô of a protection home in Agra. This was followed by a slew of PILs concerning mentally ill prisoners languishing in jails, the state of the public Shahdara Mental Hospital in Delhi and the detention of abandoned children and those with mental retardation ‚Äòin jails for safe custody‚Äô. The responses from the Supreme Court included orders for monitoring of the home, direction to the NHRC to monitor specific mental hospitals, declaration of the keeping of mentally ill in jails as illegal and unconstitutional and against Articles 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) and 22 (protection against arrest and detention in certain cases) of the Indian constitution.

Although the NHRC Report of 1999 could be perceived as a ‚Äòdefining moment‚Äô in improving mental health care, the findings may have gathered dust but for the Erwadi tragedy, a fire that engulfed mentally ill persons who had been chained and kept in confinement in a faith-based institution in the southern state of Tamil Nadu in 2001. A PIL followed soon after. The apex court directed the central government to conduct a survey on an all-India basis to ascertain if the NHRC recommendations were being followed. The court directed states which did not have mental hospitals to set up mental hospitals to serve their constituents. As a result, new state psychiatric hospitals were set up in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. 

The Supreme Court concerning the management of mental hospitals decided the following cases

1. In B.R. Kapoor v. Union of India and PUCL v. Union of India, both relating to the functioning of the hospitals for mental diseases, Shahdara, Delhi.

2. R.C. Narayan v. State of Bihar and the order dated 11.11.97 the case concerning the Ranchi Mental Asylum.

3. Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee v. State of MP , where the Supreme Court intervened to improve the working of the Gwalior Mental Asylum.

A perusal of the above referred cases clearly revel that until recently many mentally ill persons were consigned to jails and those living in mental health institutions were no better off, as the conditions both in prisons and in mental institutions were far below the stipulated standards. Sheela Barse v. Union of India concerned the detention of non-criminal mentally ill persons in the jails of West Bersal. The appalling conditions in which they were held was noted by the Supreme Court which observed that admission of non-criminal mentally ill persons to jails is illegal and unconstitutional.

Similarly in Chandan Kumar v. State of West Bersal, the Supreme Court heard of the inhuman conditions in which mentally ill persons were held in mental hospital at mankaundi in the District of Hooghli. The Court denounced this practice and ordered the cessation of the practice of tying up the patients who wee unruly or not physically controllable with iron chains and ordered medical treatment for these patients. 

Overall, the Supreme Court of India has played a proactive role in safeguarding the human rights of persons with mental illness. Its interventions have not only led to the development of a more rights-based legal framework but have also raised awareness about the importance of respecting the dignity and autonomy of individuals with mental health conditions in all aspects of society.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder [Schizotypal Disorder]

Schizotypal personality disorder (STPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pattern of peculiar thoughts, behaviors, and difficulties in social interactions. It is considered a personality disorder and is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Odd beliefs or magical thinking: They may hold beliefs that are unusual or superstitious, such as thinking they have special powers or a sixth sense.

2. Eccentric behavior or appearance: They may dress in unusual ways or engage in eccentric behaviors that others may find odd or strange.

3. Social and interpersonal difficulties: People with STPD often struggle with forming and maintaining close relationships. They may feel anxious or uncomfortable in social situations, leading to social isolation.

4. Paranoid or suspicious thoughts: They may have a tendency to interpret events as having hidden or malevolent meanings and may be suspicious of others.

5. Unusual perceptual experiences: They may report having strange or distorted experiences of their senses, such as seeing or hearing things that others do not.

6. Odd speech patterns: They may use unusual or idiosyncratic language, which can make their communication style difficult to understand.

7. Anxiety and social discomfort: They may experience high levels of anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance of social interactions.

It's important to note that while some features of schizotypal personality disorder may resemble those seen in schizophrenia, STPD is a distinct disorder and does not necessarily progress to schizophrenia. However, individuals with STPD may be at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia or other related disorders.

Treatment for schizotypal personality disorder often involves a combination of therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or social skills training, and medication, particularly if there are co-occurring conditions like depression or anxiety. The goal of treatment is to help individuals manage their symptoms, improve their social functioning, and enhance their overall quality of life.

Dependent Personality Disorder [Dependent PD]

Dependent personality disorder (DPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive dependency on others. Individuals with dependent personality disorder often feel helpless, fear separation or abandonment, and rely heavily on others to meet their emotional and physical needs. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Here are some common features associated with dependent personality disorder:

1. Excessive need for reassurance: People with DPD have an intense need for reassurance and approval from others. They may seek constant advice and validation to make even minor decisions.

2. Difficulty making decisions: Individuals with DPD often struggle with making decisions independently. They may feel overwhelmed by the fear of making the wrong decision and rely on others to make choices for them.

3. Submissive and clingy behavior: They tend to be submissive and passive in their relationships, often deferring to others and avoiding expressing their own needs or desires. They may go to great lengths to avoid disagreements or conflict, even at the expense of their own well-being.

4. Fear of abandonment: Individuals with DPD have an intense fear of being alone or abandoned. They may tolerate mistreatment or remain in unhealthy relationships out of fear of being left alone.

5. Difficulty initiating and maintaining relationships: They often struggle to initiate and maintain relationships independently. They may rely heavily on one person or a small group of people for their emotional and practical needs.

6. Low self-confidence: People with DPD tend to have low self-esteem and lack confidence in their own abilities and decision-making skills. They may underestimate their own capabilities and rely on others to define their self-worth.

7. Avoidance of independence and responsibility: They may actively avoid situations that require them to be independent or take on responsibilities. This avoidance may perpetuate their dependency on others.

Treatment for dependent personality disorder typically involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy. The goals of therapy may include:

1. Enhancing self-esteem and self-confidence: Helping individuals with DPD develop a more positive self-image, increase self-confidence, and recognize their own abilities and strengths.

2. Developing assertiveness skills: Teaching individuals effective communication and assertiveness skills to express their needs, opinions, and desires in relationships.

3. Addressing fear of abandonment: Exploring the underlying fears and insecurities related to abandonment and developing coping strategies to manage these anxieties.

4. Encouraging independence and autonomy: Supporting individuals in gradually taking on more responsibility and making independent decisions to foster their sense of self-reliance.

5. Building a support network: Assisting individuals in developing healthy relationships and a supportive network of friends and loved ones to reduce excessive dependency on one person.

It's important for individuals with dependent personality disorder to work with a mental health professional who specializes in treating personality disorders. With appropriate treatment and support, individuals with DPD can learn to develop healthier coping mechanisms, increase their independence, and improve their overall quality of life.

Histrionic Personality Disorder [Histrionic PD]

Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Individuals with histrionic personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Attention-seeking behavior: They have a strong desire to be the center of attention and often engage in dramatic or exaggerated behaviors to gain attention and admiration from others.

2. Excessive emotionality: People with HPD may display exaggerated emotions and have difficulty controlling their emotions. They may express their emotions in a dramatic or theatrical manner, often seeking reassurance and validation from others.

3. Inappropriate seductive or provocative behavior: They may engage in sexually seductive or flirtatious behaviors, even in inappropriate situations. They may use their physical appearance to draw attention and may have an excessive focus on their appearance.

4. Shallow and rapidly shifting emotions: Their emotions can be shallow and change rapidly, often influenced by external events or the attention received from others. They may quickly shift from one emotional state to another.

5. Strong need for approval: Individuals with HPD have an intense need for approval and affirmation from others. They may go to great lengths to please others and fear rejection or disapproval.

6. Difficulty maintaining relationships: They may have difficulty maintaining long-term relationships because their behavior can be seen as superficial, insincere, or attention-seeking. Their intense emotions and demands for attention can strain relationships.

7. Suggestibility and impressionability: People with HPD may be easily influenced by others and may adopt the opinions and behaviors of those they seek attention from. They may have difficulty making independent decisions.

Treatment for histrionic personality disorder typically involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy. The goals of therapy may include:

1. Developing more realistic self-perception: Helping individuals with HPD gain a more balanced and realistic view of themselves, their abilities, and their relationships.

2. Addressing underlying emotional issues: Exploring and processing underlying emotional vulnerabilities, insecurities, or past experiences that contribute to the development and maintenance of HPD.

3. Building healthier coping strategies: Developing more adaptive ways of coping with emotions, stress, and the need for attention and validation.

4. Improving interpersonal skills: Enhancing communication skills, empathy, and the ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships based on genuine connections.

It's important for individuals with histrionic personality disorder to work with a mental health professional experienced in treating personality disorders. Although change can be challenging, therapy can provide valuable support and guidance in managing symptoms, improving relationships, and enhancing overall well-being.

World Mental Health Day 2023 [Mental health is a universal human right] Our Minds Our Rights [Oct 10]

Every year we celebrate World Mental Health Day on 10 October. The theme for 2023, set by the World Foundation of Mental Health, is ‚ÄòMental health is a universal human right‚Äô.  

World Mental Health Day 2023 is an opportunity for people and communities to unite behind the theme ‚ÄòMental health is a universal human right‚Äù to improve knowledge, raise awareness and drive actions that promote and protect everyone‚Äôs mental health as a universal human right.

Mental health is a basic human right for all people. Everyone, whoever and wherever they are, has a right to the highest attainable standard of mental health. This includes the right to be protected from mental health risks, the right to available, accessible, acceptable, and good quality care, and the right to liberty, independence and inclusion in the community.

Good mental health is vital to our overall health and well-being. Yet one in eight people globally are living with mental health conditions, which can impact their physical health, their well-being, how they connect with others, and their livelihoods. Mental health conditions are also affecting an increasing number of adolescents and young people.  

Having a mental health condition should never be a reason to deprive a person of their human rights or to exclude them from decisions about their own health. Yet all over the world, people with mental health conditions continue to experience a wide range of human rights violations. Many are excluded from community life and discriminated against, while many more cannot access the mental health care they need or can only access care that violates their human rights.

World Mental Health Day is about raising awareness of mental health and driving positive change for everyone‚Äôs mental health.

World Mental Health Day is an international observance held on October 10th each year to raise awareness about mental health issues, promote mental well-being, and advocate for improved mental health care services globally. The day provides an opportunity to break the stigma surrounding mental health and encourage individuals to seek help when needed. Here are some key points and themes associated with World Mental Health Day:

Awareness and Education: World Mental Health Day aims to educate people about various mental health conditions, reduce misconceptions, and spread awareness about the importance of mental health.

Advocacy: It serves as a platform for advocates, organizations, and individuals to call for better mental health policies, resources, and support systems.

Stigma Reduction: Stigma is a significant barrier to seeking mental health care. The day encourages open discussions to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues.

Global Effort: World Mental Health Day is observed worldwide, with various organizations, governments, and communities participating in activities and events to promote mental well-being.

Expressed Emotion (Component of Expressed Emotion) 

Expressed emotion (EE) refers to care giver's attitude towards a person with a mental disorder as reflected by comments about the patient made to an interviewer. The empirical data show that EE is one of the major psychosocial stressor and it has direct association with recurrence of illness. 

A 1956 study of readmissions of schizophrenia patients in London by George Brown found that patients discharged to live with their parents or wives were more frequently readmitted than those discharged to live with siblings or non-family in lodging houses. It also found that those that lived with their mothers were more likely to be readmitted if the mothers did not work outside the home, suggesting that the duration of exposure to certain family members was related to relapse. Brown devised the five dimensions of expressed emotion to quantify the interpersonal environmental exposures of patients

George Brown explained five components of expressed emotion which includes critical comments, hostility, EOI, positive remarks, and warmth.
 
The construct of high expressed emotion comprises of the following factors: Criticism, hostility, and emotional overinvolvement. The low expressed emotion components are warmth and positive regard. 

The presence of High Expressed Emotion within the family context may in itself constitute a traumatic experience and may exacerbate or even trigger an episode of psychosis in a susceptible individual. Expressions of emotion which might not affect other individuals may adversely affect people suffering from or susceptible to psychosis. The good news is that by being aware of this, families and carers can adapt their behaviour in a way that benefits the mental health of their loved one.

Families often feel criticised and held to blame when incidence of High Expressed Emotion in the home is discussed. Supporting a loved one with a mental illness can be extremely challenging. It is completely understandable that emotions sometimes run high in the home under such circumstances. Understanding the effect that High Expressed Emotion can have on an individual suffering from or susceptible to psychosis however, and adapting behaviour to lower the levels of ‚Äòhigh expressed emotion‚Äô in the home can improve the mental health of the individual and in turn reduce stress experienced by family and carers.

Family therapy can be really useful in identifying incidence of High Expressed Emotion in the home and formulating different, more helpful ways of interacting as a family. Understanding the symptoms of psychosis will also better enable family and carers to see behaviour as a manifestation of illness rather than as an intrinsic aspect of their loved one. Understanding can reduce feelings of hostility, frustration, anger, anxiety, sadness and blame which sometimes arise in response to symptoms. 

Caring for a person with schizophrenia is highly challenging and it might result in negative emotional atmosphere in the patient's family. This emotional atmosphere means the quality of caregiver's attitudes and relationships toward the patients is a robust variable which can negatively affect both the patients and caregivers. Moreover, this negative family atmosphere causes not only relapse of symptoms and re-hospitalization, but it has significant effect on the course of the illness.

Dysgraphia [ Learning Disability ] Writing Problem 

Dysgraphia is a learning disability of written expression, that affects the ability to write, primarily handwriting, but also coherence. Dysgraphia is a brain-based learning disability that affects writing. 

Dysgraphia is a neurological disorder of written expression that impairs writing ability and fine motor skills. It is a learning disability that affects children and adults, and interferes with practically all aspects of the writing process, including spelling, legibility, word spacing and sizing, and expression.

It‚Äôs estimated that 5 to 10 percent of all children have some type of writing deficit like dysgraphia

- Trouble forming letters shapes

- Tight, awkward, or painful grip on a pencil

- Difficulty following a line or staying within margins

- Trouble with sentence structure or following rules of grammar when writing, but not when speaking

- Difficulty organizing or articulating thoughts on paper

- Pronounced difference between spoken and written understanding of a topic

Initially, children with impaired handwriting benefit from activities that support learning to form letters:

- playing with clay to strengthen hand muscles;

- keeping lines within mazes to develop motor control;
- connecting dots or dashes to create complete letter forms;
- tracing letters with index finger or eraser end of pencil;
- imitating the teacher modeling sequential strokes in letter formation; and
- copying letters from models.

Subsequently, once children learn to form legible letters, they benefit from instruction that helps them develop automatic letter writing, using the following steps to practice each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a different order daily:

- studying numbered arrow cues that provide a consistent plan for letter formation
- covering the letter with a 3 x 5 card and imaging the letter in the mind‚Äôs eye
- writing the letter from memory after interval that increases in duration over the handwriting lessons
- writing letters from dictation (spoken name to letter form).

Neurobiology of Specific Learning Disorder [Neurobiology of SLD]

Learning disabilities are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by failure to acquire, retrieve, and use information competently. These disorders have a multifactorial aetiology and are most common and severe in children, especially when comorbid with other chronic health conditions

The most prevalent view of SLDs among researchers and clinicians is that these are specific in nature. For instance, children with dyslexia display severe deficits in reading, whereas children with dyscalculia present with arithmetic deficits. Moreover, these specific behavioral profiles are thought to arise from isolated core deficits shared among children with the same label.

Studies of SLDs are guided by evidence from case studies of adult neuropsychological patients, where lesions to single brain regions have been associated with specific deficits in cognitive processing within single domains

Extraordinary progress in functional brain imaging, primarily advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging, now allows scientists to understand the neural systems serving reading and how these systems differ in dyslexic readers. Scientists now speak of the neural signature of dyslexia, a singular achievement that for the first time has made what was previously a hidden disability, now visible. Paralleling this achievement in understanding the neurobiology of dyslexia, progress in the identification and treatment of dyslexia now offers the hope of identifying children at risk for dyslexia at a very young age and providing evidence-based, effective interventions. Despite these advances, for many dyslexic readers, becoming a skilled, automatic reader remains elusive, in great part because though children with dyslexia can be taught to decode words, teaching children to read fluently and automatically represents the next frontier in research on dyslexia

Recent findings now present a competing view: other cognitive processes are involved in reading, particularly attentional mechanisms, and that disruption of these attentional mechanisms play a causal role in reading difficulties. Recognition of the role of attentional mechanisms in reading now offer potentially new strategies for interventions in dyslexia. In particular, the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents affecting attentional mechanisms not only may provide a window into the neurochemical mechanisms underlying dyslexia but also may offer a potential adjunct treatment for teaching dyslexic readers to read fluently and automatically. Preliminary studies suggest that agents traditionally used to treat disorders of attention, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, may prove to be an effective adjunct to improving reading in dyslexic students.

Learning disabilities are the product of neurological damage which occurs during fetal development. The malformations produced are unique to each individual and do not resemble acquired neurological damage. Consequently, models of developmental disorders must be developed independently and cannot be based on acquired adult aphasia or dyslexia literature. Neurological conditions of adults with developmental disorders are difficult to interpret since aberrations that occur early during fetal development can have a cascading effect, disrupting neural organization in other brain regions. An appreciation of basic concepts of brain development suggests treatment interventions that will modify neurophysiological functioning.

Specific Learning Disability Certification [SLD disability certification] RPWD Act, 2016

Specific learning disability (SLD) is characterized by one or more significant impairments in acquisition of reading, spelling, or arithmetical skills, which are not the direct result of other disorders (such as mental retardation, gross neurological deficits, uncorrected visual or auditory problems, or emotional disturbances) or inadequate schooling.

SLD assessments 

The child has to be brought at (minimum) least three times to the Child Guidance clinic Clinic for various assessments as per appointments given.

These cannot be combined into a single session as this gets very taxing for the child and error/false reporting can occur. 

The dates of appointments for these testing are given by the Secretary in the child guidance Clinic and the entire procedure to be followed will be clearly explained by her to each parent.

Appointment for assessment may be available after many months (there is a waiting period from 7 to 10 months) to get SLD assessment first appointment. It depends upon the waiting list numbers. Total duration to get the SLD disability certification is somewhere in the range of 9 to 15 months.

The first appointment is given for child‚Äôs detailed clinical and neurological examination. (which takes about 30 minutes to be completed).

The second appointment is for testing the child‚Äôs intellectual capacity (IQ testing). (which takes about 60-90 minutes to be completed).

The third appointment is for the educational testing of the child. (which takes about 60-90 minutes to be completed).

In general the accompanying parent would have to take a half-day off from work / other family responsibilities for each of the three appointments

Generally it takes about three weeks from the date of appointment of SLD assessment; beginning from the time of the first assessment done in the Child Guidance clinic (namely, the child‚Äôs detailed clinical and neurological examination).

 The certificate will be issued to the parent(s) after a meeting with the Counselor in the Child Guidance Clinic who will explain the child‚Äôs diagnosis and how to help the child achieve his/her maximum potential.

None of these examinations are painful or inconvenient to the child. The child need not be starving for any of these ‚Äòtests‚Äô.

Vision testing to be done by an Ophthalmologist (Eye Specialist). Hearing testing (Audiometry) to be done from an ENT Specialist and Eye test from Ophthalmologist may be required. Both the vision and hearing testing reports should be recent (done in the past 3 months) to be considered valid

In recent years, awareness about SLD has increased manifolds due to media. Now there are standardized tests to assess the disability and it`s severity. The demand for SLD certificate has increased out of proportion; parents and teachers both want to avail advantages of the SLD certificates, irrespective of the child`s level of disability. The use of the certificate for deserving students is righteous. But in our country abuse of a facility is growing like a menace.

Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2023

Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare services from a distance, by use of information and communication technology. There have been no statutory regulations or official guidelines in India specific for telemedicine practice and allied matters till 2020. For the first time, the government of India released telemedicine practice guidelines for Registered Medical Practitioners on March 25, 2020, amid the COVID‚Äê19 outbreak. After three years now the second edition of Telemedicine Practice Guidelines have been released on 2023 under the regulations of NMC Act 2019

The Telemedicine Guidelines 2023 permit Doctors to provide teleconsultation for prescribing medicines, providing counseling, and imparting health education. A doctor may use any digital mode (text/audio/video) for patient consultation, e.g. telephone, mobile or landline phones, chat platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc., other mobile apps or internet-based digital platforms for telemedicine or data transmission systems like Skype/ email/ fax, etc. Telemedicine Practice Guidelines do not ban social media for consultation. This was a strategic move by the Indian government to reach the last person in a remote village to provide care. The user-friendly ecosystem and widespread use of social media have necessitated this move to reach the public at large.

The guidelines are with a restricted scope for providing medical consultation to patients, excluding other aspects of telemedicine such as research and evaluation and the continuing education of healthcare workers. The guidelines have elaborated on the eligibility for practicing Telemedicine in India, the modes and types of teleconsultations, delved into the doctor‚Äêpatient relationship, consent, and management protocols, and touched upon the data security and privacy aspects of Teleconsultation. The decision to manage the specific condition in teleconsultation or otherwise is left to the professional judgment of the RMP. Conversely, if a patient prefers in‚Äêperson consultation over teleconsultation, the same cannot be forced upon him. The guidelines take a balanced approach in managing the patient preferences and professional caliber of the RMP. Thus, it provides for shared decision making between the patient and the healthcare provider in terms of utilizing the services. All records of the patient consultation shall be maintained similar to the in‚Äêperson consultation similar to previous guidelines of 2020. The concept of informed consent has been included as an essential element in teleconsultation. Implicit or implied consent is taken if the patient initiates the teleconsultation. An explicit consent in words understood by the patient must be obtained if the RMP initiates the consultation, and the same must be mentioned in patient records.

The guideline spells the responsibility of the platforms that facilitate telemedicine to ensure the authenticity and credentials of the RMP enlisted to provide the teleconsultation in their platform. Any violation of the norms by the firms may lead to their blacklisting. The technology platforms are supposed to appoint a grievance officer, as mentioned under the IT Act. Though the present guidelines released in India for telemedicine are comprehensive and facilitator in nature. 

There are no major changes between 2020 and 2023 guidelines. There are few changes made in the 2023 guideline, which are discussed in this video.

Generic Medicines and NMC RMP Professional Conduct Regulations 2023 [Generic vs Branded vs Patented]

Generic medicines are copies of brand-name drugs that become available after the original drug's patent protection expires. They contain the same active ingredients, in the same dosage form, strength, and route of administration as the brand-name drug. Generic medicines are sold under their chemical or generic names. They do not have a specific brand name associated with them. Generic medicines undergo a rigorous regulatory approval process to demonstrate their bioequivalence to the brand-name drug. This ensures they have the same therapeutic effect.Generic medicines must meet the same safety and quality standards as brand-name drugs. Generic medicines are generally more affordable than both brand-name drugs and branded generic medicines. They contribute to increased accessibility to medications by offering cost-effective alternatives.

Branded generic medicines are generic versions of brand-name drugs that are marketed under a specific brand name by the generic manufacturer. Like standard generic medicines, they contain the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, and route of administration as the brand-name drug. Branded generics carry a recognizable brand name, which differentiates them from standard unbranded generics. Branded generics go through the same regulatory approval process to demonstrate their equivalence to the brand-name drug and adherence to quality standards. Branded generics might be perceived as having higher quality due to the brand association, though they meet the same standards as standard generics. They are priced slightly higher than unbranded generics due to the branding but are usually more affordable than the brand-name drugs they mimic. Branded generics provide a middle ground between the trust associated with brand names and the cost savings of generics. They can increase competition and offer additional treatment options

Both generic medicines and branded generic medicines offer cost-effective alternatives to brand-name drugs, branded generics come with the added benefit of a recognizable brand name. They might be perceived as offering slightly higher quality due to this branding, even though they adhere to the same rigorous standards as generic medicines. However, both types of medicines play a crucial role in improving medication accessibility and affordability.

The NMC guidelines say, ‚ÄúEvery Registered Medical Practitioner should prescribe drugs using generic names written legibly and prescribe drugs rationally, avoiding unnecessary medications and irrational fixed-dose combination tablets.‚Äù The NMC says doctors should prescribe ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù, ‚Äúnon-proprietary‚Äù, ‚Äúpharmacological‚Äù names only and they should ‚Äòavoid‚Äô prescribing ‚Äúbranded generic drugs‚Äù. Not following the directive would first lead to an advisory being issued to a doctor and/or suspension of licence for a maximum of one month.

A pure generic drug is one which is a copy of an innovator drug ‚Äì it has no company/brand name mentioned and has only the pharmaceutical ingredients on the label. Branded generic drugs are the ones which are also copies of the innovator drug but have a brand name and are produced when the former has come off patent. They are usually cheaper than the original ones and are supposed to be manufactured without compromising safety and efficacy as comparable to the original drug. A large number of medical doctors, on various social media platforms, have shown a great deal of reluctance towards the NMC prescription guidelines, saying that due to the lack of enough regulation for ensuring quality in drugs, especially in many branded generic medicines, they tend to ‚Äòtrust‚Äô certain brands owing to feedback from their own patients. They cited empirical examples to support this. And the regulation will take away their right to choose the prescription, they say. However, another section of voices says that while there are scientific studies to say that an innovator brand was more effective than the generics, not every doctor‚Äôs feedback is based on such studies because their number is far and few. They bring into the fore the importance of ‚Äòaccess to medicines‚Äô as generics or branded generics are cheaper than the original drugs.

Nonetheless, the IMA has said that the new notification only puts the ball in the court of the chemist as s/he would decide which drug for the formulation prescribed by the doctor has to be dispensed to the patient ‚Äî rather than the doctor taking this call ‚Äì and this wouldn‚Äôt necessarily ensure the best interest of the patient.

The National Medical Commission (NMC) has notified the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023. These Regulations have come into force on 3rd August, 2023. The regulations focus on various aspects of a doctor‚Äôs responsibilities, including prescribing practices, professional qualifications, remuneration, and maintaining patient records.

Highlights of the NMC Conduct Regulations:

Duties and Responsibilities: The regulations emphasize that at the time of applying for registration under the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, Registered Medica Practitioners (RMPs) are deemed to have read and agreed to abide by these conduct regulations.

Suffixes and Modern Medicine: RMPs are required to display their unique registration ID assigned by the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) on prescriptions, certificates, and receipts provided to patients. The suffix to a doctor‚Äôs name must only reflect NMC-recognized and accredited medical degrees or diplomas. Foreign-trained RMPs must use NMC-approved prefixes and suffixes to clarify their qualifications.

Specialization and Training: RMPs are prohibited from claiming to be clinical specialists unless they possess NMC-recognized training and qualifications in the respective branch of modern medicine. The list of recognized degrees and diplomas will be available on the NMC website.

Scope of Practice: RMPs are required to practice only the system of medicine for which they are trained and certified. They are also prohibited from collaborating with unqualified individuals for medical treatments or procedures.

Professional Development and Licensing: To ensure continued competence, RMPs are mandated to attend regular professional development programs, totaling at least 30 credit hours every five years. License renewal is required every five years, and RMPs must pay the necessary fee to practice in specific states.

Remuneration and Patient Information: RMPs must inform patients about consultation fees before providing examination or treatment. They should also provide patients with an estimate of surgical or treatment costs, enabling informed decisions. RMPs can refuse treatment if fees are not paid, except in government service or emergencies.

Patient Solicitation Prohibited: RMPs are forbidden from directly or indirectly soliciting patients, whether individually or as part of groups, institutions, or organizations.

Prescription Guidelines: RMPs must prescribe drugs using generic names and avoid unnecessary medications or irrational drug combinations. They are allowed to sell medication only to their own patients and not run an open shop to sell medicines prescribed by other RMPs.

Medical Records: RMPs must maintain patient medical records for three years, using a standard format provided by the NMC. Medical records should be digitized within three years, adhering to privacy laws.

These new regulations mark a significant step towards enhancing the accountability, transparency, and ethical standards within the medical profession. The Indian medical community awaits the positive impacts these regulations are expected to bring to the healthcare sector.

Specific Learning Disorder [Developmental Learning Disorder] Learning Disorder [ Part 2 ] SLD

Specific learning disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders that are typically diagnosed in early school-aged children, although may not be recognized until adulthood.

Specific Learning Disability interferes with the normal learning process of the person. The term does not include learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, hearing or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural or economic disadvantage.

 They are characterized by a persistent impairment in at least one of three major areas: 
- reading, 
- written expression, and/or 
- math.

An estimated five to 15% of school-age children struggle with a learning disability. In India the prevalence of Specific Learning Disorder varies from 8-10% of the population.  

An estimated 80% of those with learning disorders have an impairment in reading in particular (commonly referred to as dyslexia).

There is a high comorbidity of specific learning disorder with other neurodevelopmental disorders (such as ADHD) as well as anxiety.

Learning disorders are often noticed for the first time when a child is in preschool or elementary school. Specific signs are different depending on what the child has trouble with. 

Signs and symptoms include:  

Struggling to: 
‚Äî Read 
‚Äî Write
‚Äî Rhyme 
‚Äî Oral expression
‚Äî Listening comprehension
‚Äî Written expression
‚Äî Basic reading skill
‚Äî Reading fluency skills
‚Äî Reading comprehension
‚Äî Mathematics calculation or problem solving
‚Äî Put sounds in the right order 
‚Äî Talking later than other children 
‚Äî Trouble remembering words  
‚Äî Having trouble sounding out words they don‚Äôt know 
‚Äî Trouble doing math problems 
‚Äî Difficulty understanding the logic behind math problems 
‚Äî  Confusing basic symbols such as ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù 
‚Äî Making many small mistakes in math problems, like being off by one  

Some children with a learning disorder can use these skills when a teacher is guiding them, but then they have trouble when they are on their own.

Children having SLD have been found to be suffering from various psychiatric comorbidities. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common comorbid condition with SLD followed by anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and language disorder.  Many children with SLD can experience low self-esteem, lack of confidence, low expectations for themselves, and poor peer relationship because of their poor learning skills.  Studies from India have also reported various clinical problems associated with SLD, such as problem with developmental history, behavioral problems, neurotic traits, lower self-esteem, poor social competence, and high-state anxiety, that make management of SLD difficult.

Outcomes for individuals with learning disorders vary depending on the extent of the difficulty as well as how it is treated. Research shows that, if untreated, a person with a learning disorder can experience a range of negative outcomes including academic failure, the development of disruptive behaviours at school, increased likelihood of school drop-out, unemployment, social difficulties, low self-esteem and depression.

However, with the right type of help and support many people can overcome their difficulties to the extent that they can go on to lead happy and successful lives.

It is important when seeking treatment options, to consider only those interventions that are proven to be effective.

Paranoid personality disorder [Paranoid PD]

Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pervasive pattern of distrust, suspicion, and a belief that others have malicious intentions. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Individuals with paranoid personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Suspicion and distrust: They often have a deep-rooted and unwarranted suspicion of others. They may believe that others are deceiving, exploiting, or betraying them without sufficient evidence.

2. Hypervigilance: People with PPD are constantly on guard, searching for signs of potential harm or betrayal in their interactions with others. They may interpret neutral or innocent actions as intentionally threatening or hostile.

3. Reluctance to confide in others: Due to their fear of being exploited or betrayed, individuals with PPD are often reluctant to share personal information or trust others with their thoughts and feelings.

4. Perceived attacks on reputation: They may interpret harmless comments or actions as personal attacks on their character or reputation. They may hold grudges or become excessively angry or defensive in response.

5. Limited forgiveness: Individuals with PPD tend to have difficulties forgiving perceived insults or injuries. They may harbor long-lasting resentment and have a tendency to bear grudges.

6. Social isolation: People with PPD may have few, if any, close relationships. Their suspiciousness and mistrust can make it challenging for them to form and maintain connections with others.

7. Emotional detachment: They often exhibit emotional guardedness and may be reluctant to express vulnerable emotions. They may strive to maintain emotional distance to protect themselves from perceived threats.

It is important to note that individuals with paranoid personality disorder often experience significant distress and impairment in their personal and professional lives. However, they may not be aware of the impact of their suspiciousness on their relationships or seek help unless they are motivated to address their concerns.

Treatment for paranoid personality disorder typically involves psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy. The goal of therapy is to help individuals with PPD develop healthier ways of thinking, improve their social functioning, and manage their anxiety and suspiciousness. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to target specific symptoms, such as anxiety or depression, that can co-occur with PPD.

Schizoid Personality Disorder [Schizoid PD]

Schizoid personality disorder (SPD) is a mental health condition characterized by a pattern of detachment from social relationships, limited emotional expression, and a preference for solitary activities. It is classified as a personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

Individuals with schizoid personality disorder may exhibit the following features:

1. Emotional detachment: They tend to have a restricted range of emotions and may appear indifferent or detached from social interactions.

2. Limited desire for close relationships: People with SPD typically have little interest in forming close relationships, including romantic relationships, and may prefer to spend time alone.

3. Preference for solitary activities: They often engage in activities that can be done alone, such as reading, playing video games, or pursuing solitary hobbies.

4. Lack of enjoyment in social interactions: Individuals with SPD usually have limited pleasure or interest in participating in social events or activities that involve interactions with others.

5. Emotional coldness: They may appear distant or aloof, showing little emotional responsiveness or empathy toward others.

6. Anhedonia: They may have difficulty experiencing pleasure or may have a reduced capacity to enjoy activities that are typically enjoyable for others.

7. Limited social skills: People with SPD often have difficulty in social situations and may struggle with initiating or maintaining conversations and may exhibit awkwardness or social anxiety.

It's important to note that individuals with schizoid personality disorder are not necessarily prone to developing psychosis or schizophrenia. While there may be some overlap in features with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, schizoid personality disorder primarily involves social and emotional detachment rather than the presence of hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking.

Treatment for schizoid personality disorder often involves therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or psychodynamic therapy, aimed at improving social skills, addressing underlying emotional issues, and enhancing overall well-being. However, it can be challenging to engage individuals with SPD in therapy due to their disinterest in social interactions and limited motivation for change.

ICMR ethics guidelines for application of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical and Healthcare Research


The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has released the country‚Äôs first Ethical Guidelines for Application of Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Research and Healthcare, aimed at creating ‚Äúan ethics framework which can assist in the development, deployment, and adoption of AI-based solutions‚Äù in the fields specified.

Through this, they hope to make ‚ÄúAI-assisted platforms available for the benefit of largest section of common people with safety and highest precision possible,‚Äù while also addressing emerging ethical challenges when it comes to AI in biomedical research and healthcare delivery. 

The document, prepared by the Department of Health Research and ICMR Artificial Intelligence Cell, Delhi, will be updated as and when the need arises, said a senior Health Ministry official. Developed through extensive discussions with experts and ethicists, the guidelines include sections on ethical principles, guiding principles for stakeholders, an ethics review process, governance of AI use, and informed consent.

The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure ethical conduct and address emerging ethical challenges in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedical research and healthcare. These guidelines are also meant to provide a framework for ethical decision-making in medical AI during the development, deployment, and adoption of AI-based solutions. The guidelines are intended for all stakeholders involved in research on AI in biomedical research and healthcare, including creators, developers, researchers, clinicians, ethics committees, institutions, sponsors, and funding organizations. The guidelines include sections on ethical principles, guiding principles for stakeholders, an ethics review process, governance of AI use, and informed consent. They have been developed through extensive discussions with experts and ethicists. The guidelines are a living document and will be updated as ethics in AI evolve.

Development, as well as deployment of AI-based solutions in healthcare, span a number of issues, including those related to data safety, data sharing, and data privacy, say experts. The document says that as AI technologies are further developed and applied in clinical decision making, it is important to have processes that discuss accountability in case of errors. As per the guidelines, the ethical review process for AI in health comes under the domain of the ethics committee. The document notes that the regulation of AI technologies in healthcare is still in its nascent stage even in developed countries.

India already offers streamlining of AI technologies in various sectors including healthcare through the National Health Policy (2017), National Digital Health Blueprint (NDHB 2019), and Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (2018) proposed by the Health Ministry which will pave the way for the establishment of the National Data Health Authority and other health information exchanges.

Tardive Syndrome (TS) Drug induced movement disorders 

Tardive syndromes are a group of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic movement disorders that occur after some delay following exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents such as antipsychotic and anti-emetic drugs. 

Dopamine receptorÔªø-blocking antipsychotics, first introduced into clinical practice in 1952, were hailed as a panacea in the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. However, within 5 years, this notion was to be shattered by the recognition of both acute and chronic drug-induced movement disorders which can accompany their administration. Tardive syndromes, denoting the delayed onset of movement disorders following administration of dopamine receptor-blocking (and also other) drugs, have diverse manifestations ranging from the classic oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia, through dystonic craniocervical and trunk posturing, to abnormal breathing patterns. Although tardive syndromes have been an important part of movement disorder clinical practice for over 60 years, their pathophysiologic basis remains poorly understood and the optimal treatment approach remains unclear.

Tardive syndrome (TS) is a group of movement disorders caused by the long-term use of dopamine receptor blocking agents. The phenotypic presentation of TS is diverse, ranging from the most well-characterized symptom of tardive dyskinesia to other symptoms, including dystonia, akathisia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, tremor, and tics. These tardive symptoms are distinct not only in their phenomenology but also in their clinical outcomes. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology and management of TS is almost exclusively based on tardive dyskinesia. First-generation antipsychotics have a higher risk of inducing TS and have largely been replaced by second-generation antipsychotics with a lower risk of TS. However, patients with off-label use of second-generation antipsychotics are still at risk of developing TS. Thus, the management of TS remains a challenging and important issue for physicians. In this review, we update the information on the epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment of TS from the perspective of the specific form of TS.

The severity of Tardive Syndrome ranges from mild to disabling or even life-threatening. There is a wide range of recognized tardive phenomenologies that may occur in isolation or in combination with each other. These phenomenologies include stereotypy, dystonia, chorea, akathisia, myoclonus, tremor, tics, gait disorders, parkinsonism, ocular deviations, respiratory dyskinesia, and a variety of sensory symptoms. Recognition of the various tardive phenomenologies may not only lead to early diagnosis but also to appropriate therapeutic intervention. 

TS is diverse not only in its phenomenology but also in its clinical outcomes. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is still unclear and warrants further research. Future studies including patients with well-classified phenomenology may provide additional insights into the understanding of the disorder as well as treatment.

Akathisia [Antipsychotic induced movement disorder]

Akathisia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that can occur as an adverse effect of antipsychotic medications and manifests as psychomotor restlessness. In recent years, akathisia has additionally been found to occur in certain individuals as an adverse effect of with calcium channel blockers, antiemetics, anti-vertigo drugs, cocaine, and sedatives used in anesthesia. Akathisia is defined as an inability to remain still. It is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is associated with psychomotor restlessness. The individual with akathisia will generally experience an intense sensation of unease or an inner restlessness that usually involves the lower extremities. This results in a compulsion to move. In most cases the movement is repetitive. The individual may cross, uncross, swing, or shift from one foot to the other. To the observer, this may appear as a persistent fidget. 

Akathisia is frequently associated with the use of antipsychotics (neuroleptics), but it can also complicate the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Other causes of akathisia include anxiety disorders, drug withdrawal or discontinuation states, early serotonin syndrome, restless legs syndrome, iron deficiency anemia and endocrinopathies. It is therefore important to find the underlying cause by identifying drug precipitants and associated psychopathology and excluding general medical causes. The pathophysiology of akathisia is not fully understood, but a combination of hypodopaminergic and hyperserotonergic neurotransmission may be implicated. This hypothesis is supported by the emergence of akathisia following the initiation of antipsychotics or SSRIs, but also from the observation that dopamine agonists can alleviate psychomotor agitation associated with restless legs syndrome

Akathisia can have a significant negative impact on quality of life and is associated with increased suicidality. Treatment of this distressing condition is difficult and treatment options are limited.

Antipsychotic-induced akathisia may be managed by reducing the dose of the offending agent or switching to an alternative antipsychotic agent. Beta-blockers such as propranolol and benzodiazepines have historically been used for the treatment of akathisia although the amount of high-quality data supporting their use is limited. Anticholinergic agents such as benztropine may be utilized if concomitant pseudoparkinsonism is present. Mirtazapine may also be utilized for the management of akathisia. Low-dose mirtazapine has been found to be as effective as beta-blockers and may be considered first-line therapy.

When using beta-blockers, clinicians should be aware of the risk of bradycardia and hypotension. Many other agents, including vitamin B6, have been used to treat akathisia, but there are no randomized controlled trials to determine their efficacy

Unfortunately, once akathisia has developed it can take months for the disorder to subside. Case reports exist indicating that this movement disorder also increases the risk of suicidality. Hence, all patients with akathisia need to be closely monitored and the family should be educated about the impact of akathisia

Categorical vs Dimensional Personality Disorders

The categorical and dimensional approaches are two different ways of conceptualizing and diagnosing personality disorders.

1. Categorical Approach: The categorical approach, which has been traditionally used in psychiatric diagnosis, involves categorizing individuals into specific diagnostic categories based on the presence or absence of specific criteria. Personality disorders are viewed as discrete categories, and individuals are classified as either meeting the criteria for a specific personality disorder or not.

In the categorical approach, personality disorders are defined by a set of rigid diagnostic criteria, and individuals are diagnosed based on whether they meet a specific threshold of symptoms. This approach assumes that personality disorders are distinct entities with clear boundaries and discrete diagnostic categories.

2. Dimensional Approach: The dimensional approach takes a different perspective and emphasizes the continuum or spectrum of personality traits. It views personality disorders as dimensional constructs rather than discrete categories. According to this approach, individuals vary in the degree to which they exhibit certain traits or characteristics associated with personality disorders.

In the dimensional approach, personality traits are assessed along various dimensions or continua, such as extraversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, or interpersonal functioning. Rather than focusing on categorical diagnoses, this approach examines the degree or severity of personality traits and their impact on functioning.

The dimensional approach recognizes that personality disorders exist on a continuum, ranging from mild to severe manifestations and that individuals may exhibit a combination of different traits from various personality disorder categories.

Advantages and Disadvantages:

Categorical Approach:
- Advantages: The categorical approach provides a clear and standardized diagnostic framework, facilitating communication between professionals and enabling research and treatment planning based on specific diagnostic categories.
- Disadvantages: It may oversimplify the complexity of personality pathology by assuming discrete categories, leading to potential diagnostic heterogeneity and difficulties capturing the full range of symptom severity and functional impairment.

Dimensional Approach:
- Advantages: The dimensional approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of personality pathology, capturing the diversity and subtleties of personality traits. It provides a more nuanced assessment that aligns with the idea that personality exists on a continuum.
- Disadvantages: Implementing the dimensional approach can be challenging due to the need for well-defined trait dimensions and reliable assessment measures. There may be a lack of consensus on which dimensions to include and difficulties in establishing clear cutoffs for defining pathology.

It's worth noting that the DSM-5, which is the current edition of the diagnostic manual used by mental health professionals, primarily adopts a categorical approach to personality disorders. However, it includes an alternative model for personality disorders (Section III) that incorporates dimensional aspects, acknowledging the ongoing debate and research in the field.

Both the categorical and dimensional approaches have their merits and limitations, and the choice of approach may depend on the purpose of the assessment, the clinical context, and the specific needs of the individual.

Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) Drug induced abnormal involuntary movements 

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that causes involuntary, repetitive body movements and is commonly seen in patients who are on long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications. However, several other classes of medications with different mechanisms are also associated with TD. Tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of antipsychotic medications. These drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and other mental health disorders.

TD causes stiff, jerky movements of your face and body that you can't control. You might blink your eyes, stick out your tongue, or wave your arms without meaning to do so.

Not everyone who takes an antipsychotic drug will get it. But if it happens, it‚Äôs sometimes permanent.


Tardive dyskinesia causes stiff, jerky movements that you can't control. 

They include: Orofacial dyskinesia or oro-bucco-lingual dyskinesia: Uncontrolled movements in your face -- namely your lips, jaw, or tongue.

Presentation might be as follows:

Stick out your tongue without trying
Blink your eyes fast
Chew
Smack or pucker your lips
Puff out your cheeks
Frown
Grunt

So if you have movements you can't control, let your doctor know right away. To ease your symptoms, your doctor may:

Lower the dose
Add another medication to what you‚Äôre taking to act as an antidote
Switch you to a different drug

Treatment and Prevention

The goal is to prevent TD. When your doctor prescribes a new drug to treat a mental health disorder, ask about its side effects. The benefits of the drug should outweigh the risks.

You might need to switch to a newer antipsychotic drug that may be less likely to cause TD.

There are two FDA-approved medicines to treat tardive dyskinesia:

- Deutetrabenazine 
- Valbenazine 

Both of these medicines work in similar ways to regulate the amount of dopamine flow in brain areas that control certain kinds of movements. Both can sometimes cause drowsiness.

Medication-induced TD is a complex and unique neurologic disorder. While the reported incidence of TD seems to be less with atypical APDs compared to typical APDs, a risk of developing TD is associated with these medications, as well as others. A number of challenges with TD remain, including the ability to quantify the risk of TD caused by pharmacologic management, the difficulty of diagnosing TD even with DISCUS and other approaches, the exposure of older patients to both typical and atypical APDs, and the dyskinesia caused by other neurologic disorders. Additionally, the unclear pathophysiology of TD continues to be a problem for the successful treatment and management of the condition.

Cluster C Personality Disorders [AAPD, Dependent & Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders]

Cluster C personality disorders are a group of three personality disorders categorized in Cluster C in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). These disorders are characterized by anxious and fearful thoughts, behaviors, and emotional patterns. The three cluster C personality disorders are:

1. Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD): Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by feelings of extreme social inhibition, sensitivity to criticism or rejection, and a pervasive pattern of avoiding social interactions and new experiences. Individuals with AvPD often have an intense fear of being embarrassed or humiliated, leading to isolation and a limited social life.

2. Dependent Personality Disorder (DPD): Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of by others. People with DPD tend to have an intense fear of separation or abandonment and may exhibit submissive and clingy behavior in their relationships. They may have difficulty making decisions, relying heavily on others for guidance and support.

3. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD): Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control. Individuals with OCPD tend to have rigid and inflexible thinking patterns, a strong need for rules and order, and an excessive attention to detail. They may struggle with being overly critical of themselves and others, leading to interpersonal difficulties.

It's important to note that these personality disorders can significantly impact an individual's functioning and overall well-being. Therapy, specifically psychotherapy, is the primary approach to treating cluster C personality disorders. The goals of therapy often include:

1. Enhancing self-esteem and self-acceptance: Helping individuals develop a more positive self-image, increase self-confidence, and reduce self-criticism.

2. Addressing anxiety and fear: Providing strategies to manage anxiety and cope with fear-based thoughts and behaviors. This may involve exposure therapy or cognitive restructuring techniques.

3. Developing healthier interpersonal skills: Teaching effective communication, assertiveness, and boundary-setting skills to improve relationships and reduce dependence on others.

4. Challenging maladaptive thoughts and beliefs: Identifying and challenging negative and rigid thinking patterns that contribute to the maintenance of the personality disorder symptoms.

5. Building resilience and coping strategies: Assisting individuals in developing healthier coping mechanisms and stress management techniques to deal with life's challenges.

It's essential for individuals with cluster C personality disorders to work with qualified mental health professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists, who specialize in personality disorders. Treatment may require time, patience, and a collaborative approach to achieve significant improvements in symptoms and overall functioning.

Cluster B Personality Disorder [Antisocial, Histrionic, Borderline, and Narcissistic PD]

Cluster B personality disorders are a group of four personality disorders categorized in Cluster B in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). These disorders are characterized by dramatic, emotional, and erratic behavior patterns. Individuals with Cluster B personality disorders often have difficulties with impulse control, emotional regulation, and forming stable and healthy relationships. The four Cluster B personality disorders are:

1. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD): Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for the rights of others, a lack of empathy or remorse, and a pattern of impulsive and irresponsible behavior. Individuals with ASPD may engage in behaviors such as lying, manipulation, aggression, and a disregard for societal norms and rules.

2. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability in emotions, self-image, and interpersonal relationships. Individuals with BPD often experience intense and unstable emotions, engage in impulsive behaviors, have difficulties with self-identity, and may exhibit a fear of abandonment. They may also engage in self-harming behaviors or have a history of suicidal thoughts or attempts.

3. Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD): Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking, emotional overreaction, and a need for constant validation and approval from others. Individuals with HPD may display exaggerated emotions, engage in attention-seeking behaviors, and have a strong desire to be the center of attention. They may have difficulty maintaining stable relationships due to their tendency to be dramatic and emotionally demanding.

4. Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD): Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. Individuals with NPD may have an exaggerated sense of their own abilities and achievements, seek constant validation and admiration, and display a sense of entitlement. They may exploit others for personal gain and struggle with accepting criticism or failure.

It's important to note that individuals with Cluster B personality disorders may experience significant distress and impairment in various areas of their lives, including relationships, work, and overall well-being. Treatment for Cluster B personality disorders often involves psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or psychodynamic therapy. The goals of therapy may include:

1. Emotional regulation: Helping individuals develop healthier coping mechanisms and skills to manage intense emotions and impulsive behaviors.

2. Interpersonal effectiveness: Teaching individuals skills for establishing and maintaining healthy relationships, improving communication, and setting boundaries.

3. Self-identity and self-worth: Assisting individuals in developing a more stable and positive self-identity, improving self-esteem, and reducing reliance on external validation.

4. Cognitive restructuring: Challenging and modifying distorted thinking patterns, such as black-and-white thinking or overly self-centered beliefs, to develop more realistic and balanced perspectives.

5. Addressing self-destructive behaviors: Working on reducing self-harming behaviors, impulsive actions, or substance abuse through various therapeutic interventions.

6. Developing empathy and perspective-taking: Encouraging individuals to develop empathy and consider the needs and feelings of others, enhancing their ability to form healthier relationships.

Treatment approaches may vary depending on the specific personality disorder and the individual's unique needs. It's crucial for individuals with Cluster B personality disorders to work with qualified mental health professionals experienced in treating personality disorders to develop an individualized treatment plan. With appropriate support and therapy, individuals with Cluster B personality disorders can make progress in managing their symptoms, improving their overall functioning, and achieving greater emotional stability.

Cluster A Personality Disorders [Paranoid, Schizoid, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder]

Cluster A personality disorders are a group of three personality disorders categorized in Cluster A in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). These disorders are characterized by odd, eccentric, and peculiar behavior, as well as difficulties in social interaction and forming close relationships. The three cluster A personality disorders are:

1. Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD): Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspicion of others. Individuals with PPD may be overly suspicious of others' motives and believe that people are out to harm or deceive them. They may be hypervigilant, have difficulties in forming close relationships, and interpret neutral actions or comments as threatening.

2. Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD): Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships and a limited range of emotional expression. Individuals with SPD tend to prefer solitary activities, have little desire for close relationships (including family relationships), and may appear detached or indifferent to others. They often show little emotional response and have a restricted range of emotional expression.

3. Schizotypal Personality Disorder (STPD): Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, as well as social and interpersonal deficits. Individuals with STPD may have unusual beliefs or magical thinking, display odd or eccentric behavior, and experience discomfort in close relationships. They may have peculiarities in speech, perception, and thinking that may make it challenging for them to form and maintain social connections.

It's important to note that these personality disorders can significantly impact an individual's functioning and well-being. Treatment for cluster A personality disorders typically involves psychotherapy as the primary approach. The goals of therapy often include:

1. Building trust and therapeutic rapport: Establishing a trusting relationship between the individual and the therapist, as individuals with cluster A personality disorders may have difficulty trusting others.

2. Social skills training: Helping individuals develop and improve social skills, including communication, interpersonal problem-solving, and assertiveness, to enhance their ability to form and maintain relationships.

3. Addressing distorted thinking patterns: Challenging and modifying distorted beliefs, thoughts, and perceptions that contribute to the personality disorder symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may be utilized to identify and change maladaptive thinking patterns.

4. Enhancing self-awareness and insight: Assisting individuals in gaining a deeper understanding of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and how they impact their relationships and daily functioning.

5. Managing anxiety and improving coping skills: Teaching strategies to manage anxiety and stress and develop healthy coping mechanisms to deal with social interactions and interpersonal challenges.

It's important for individuals with cluster A personality disorders to work with qualified mental health professionals, such as psychologists or psychiatrists, who specialize in personality disorders. Treatment may require patience and time, as individuals with cluster A personality disorders may be resistant to therapy and change. With appropriate treatment and support, individuals with cluster A personality disorders can experience improvements in their overall functioning and quality of life.

Personality Disorder (Part 1) Diagnosis, Prevalence, Comorbidity and Management [ICD 11 Vs DSM V Personality Disorder]

Personality refers to a distinctive set of traits, behavior styles, and patterns that make up our character or individuality. How we perceive the world, our attitudes, thoughts, and feelings are all part of our personality. People with healthy personalities are able to cope with normal stresses and have no trouble forming relationships with family, friends, and co-workers.

A personality disorder refers to a long-term pattern of thinking, behaviour and emotion that is dysfunctional, extreme and inflexible. It causes distress and makes it difficult to function in everyday life. People with personality disorders find it hard to change their behaviour or adapt to different situations. They may have trouble sustaining work or forming positive relationships with others.

There are many different types of personality disorder. Some people with a personality disorder may appear withdrawn, some dramatic and emotional, and others odd or eccentric. The one thing they have in common is that their symptoms are severe enough to affect many different areas of life.

The causes of personality disorders are not fully understood. The personality in general is starts evolving in childhood and evolves completely in early adulthood. The combination of genetics and environment in early childhood play a crucial role in development of personality disorder. There is no single gene for personality or personality disorders ‚Äî multiple genes are involved. Having a secure bonding process or attachment between a parent (or other caregiver) and an infant provides a positive environment in which their personality can develop.

Types of personality disorders

The 10 personality disorders are classified into three clusters based on the most representative emotional responses and behaviors:

Cluster A: personality disorders share odd and eccentric features

Cluster B: personality disorders share dramatic, emotional, and erratic features

Cluster C: personality disorders share fearful and anxious features

Treatment of PD

Personality disorders present unique treatment challenges. Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, meaning they are compatible with a person's self-concept. As such, there may initially be little or no motivation to change. Nevertheless, mental health professionals have developed and applied different therapeutic techniques to help those with these conditions learn more adaptive ways of thinking and behaving, and research suggests that positive change is possible for many.

Research shows that long-term psychotherapy is the most effective treatment for all personality disorders. In some instances, some symptoms might be treated with medications such as antidepressants. But this isn‚Äôt true for every personality disorder or every individual case.

Because personality disorders all have different symptoms and triggers, they‚Äôre not all treated in the same way. The type of approach a doctor chooses will depend on symptoms, their intensity, severity, presentation and medical history.

Personality (Part 1) What is Personality? What is Trait? What are the theories of Personality?    

Personality is a set of enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that characterize an individual and make them unique. It refers to the consistent way in which an individual perceives and interacts with the world around them, including their attitudes, beliefs, values, and preferences.

Personality is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and cultural factors, and tends to remain relatively stable over time. It can be influenced by various factors, including childhood experiences, socialization, life events, and biological factors such as hormones.

There are many different theories and models of personality, but some of the most widely recognized include the Big Five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which identifies different personality types based on four dimensions: introversion/extraversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving.

There are several theories of personality that have been proposed by psychologists over the years. Some of the major ones include:

1. Psychodynamic theory: This theory, developed by Sigmund Freud, emphasizes the role of unconscious conflicts in shaping personality. According to Freud, personality is comprised of three components: the id (unconscious desires and impulses), the ego (conscious reasoning and decision-making), and the superego (internalized moral standards). Freud also proposed a series of psychosexual stages of development, which he believed influenced personality development.

2. Trait theory: This theory focuses on identifying and measuring specific traits that make up an individual's personality. The most widely recognized trait theory is the Big Five model, which identifies five broad dimensions of personality: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

3. Humanistic theory: This theory emphasizes the importance of subjective experience and personal growth in shaping personality. According to humanistic theorists such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, individuals have an innate drive to fulfill their potential and achieve self-actualization, which is the highest level of personal growth.

4. Behavioral theory: This theory focuses on the role of learning and conditioning in shaping personality. Behavioral theorists such as B.F. Skinner believe that personality is largely a product of environmental factors, including rewards and punishments.

5. Cognitive theory: This theory emphasizes the role of thought processes and mental representations in shaping personality. Cognitive theorists such as Albert Bandura believe that personality is influenced by a person's self-efficacy beliefs, which are their beliefs about their ability to succeed in different situations.

These are just a few examples of the many theories of personality that have been proposed over the years. Each theory offers a unique perspective on how personality develops and how it can be understood and measured.

There are several ways to conduct a personality assessment, and the most appropriate method will depend on the specific goals and context of the assessment. Here are some common methods for personality assessment:

1. Self-report measures: These are questionnaires or surveys that ask individuals to rate their own personality traits, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Self-report measures are often used in research and clinical settings and can be administered online or in person.

2. Projective tests: These are tests that require an individual to interpret ambiguous stimuli (such as inkblots or pictures) to reveal their unconscious thoughts, feelings, and motivations. Projective tests are often used in clinical settings and require specialized training to administer and interpret.

3. Behavioral assessments: These involve observing an individual's actual behavior in various situations to assess their personality traits and tendencies. Behavioral assessments can be conducted in a laboratory setting or in the individual's natural environment.

4. Biological assessments: These involve measuring biological factors that may be related to personality, such as genetics, brain activity, or hormone levels. Biological assessments require specialized equipment and expertise and are often used in research settings.

It's important to note that no single method of personality assessment is perfect, and each has its strengths and limitations. Therefore, it's often best to use a combination of methods to gain a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's personality.

Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 [Part 2] 

This video discusses the Protection of Women from sexual harassment in Workplace Act 2013 [POSH Act, 2013]

The Act establishes a mechanism for dealing with sexual harassment complaints in the workplace. The PoSH Act has been implemented to prevent and protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace and thereby ensure a safe working environment for women.

The PoSH Act, as mandatary compliance, requires every company having more than ten employees to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in the prescribed manner to receive and address the complaints of any sort of sexual harassment from women in a time-bound and extremely confidential manner.

The person who can file a complaint has to be a woman, the POSH Act is not gender-neutral.

The Act defines sexual harassment at the workplace and creates a mechanism for redressal of complaints and safeguards against false or malicious charges.

Every employer is required to constitute an Internal Complaints Committee(ICC) at each office or branch with 10 or more employees.

The Complaints Committees have the powers of civil courts and are required to provide for conciliation before initiating an inquiry if requested by the complainant.

Penalties have been prescribed for employers for non-compliance with the provisions of the Act.

The State Government will notify the District Officer in every district, who will constitute a Local Complaints Committee (LCC) to enable women in the unorganized sector or small establishments to work in an environment free of sexual harassment

Constituting an ICC sends a powerful message that the company is completely committed to working toward women‚Äôs safety. Nonetheless, it is important to note that constituting an ICC is a mandatory requirement under the PoSH Act and not abiding by the same can attract heavy fines including cancellation of license to conduct business operations.

Sexual harassment at the workplace is a very sensitive issue and is required to be handled with the utmost care, patience, and understanding thus, the complaints must be redressed as quickly as possible to ensure a harmonious and harassment-free workplace for all employees.

Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 [Part 1] 

This video discusses gender sensitivity, gender equality, gender vs sex, gender equity, gender awareness, and a gender-inclusive ecosystem in the workplace.   

The first and most important aspect of gender sensitivity is to be open to the perspective and feelings of any colleague of the opposite gender. This could be a simple case of knowing enough about their personal issues to a more nuanced understanding of gender-specific aspects such as comments or jokes that could be offensive.

Although there is an increasing awareness about this topic, and organizations have started to define the limits of behavior, the onus is still with the individual. Increasingly, men and women have started working together in managerial roles and unless there is a mutual sense of respect and comfort, teams will not be effective

Gender sensitization is important because representation is important. Representation of a person and community not only advocates equality but also adds a sense of inclusion to the previously marginalized community. For a healthy performance-oriented culture, organizations need the right mix of talent which is not bound by gender. In a world where accountability has become important now more than ever, organizations only have today to make the changes that count, as tomorrow they won‚Äôt be able to hide under the guise of ignorance.

Representation is at the heart of gender sensitivity. Every member of an organization seeks to learn and grow in their place of work, and an insensitive workplace not only hampers that but also becomes a hostile workplace. Gender sensitization is extremely important as it helps employees feel valued and cared for within the organization. Lastly, for the betterment of society, organizations have an ethical responsibility in shaping the current structures by breaking the previous norms.

Gender sensitivity is all about getting rid of wrong notions and perceptions, as well as learning to interact with the opposite gender. The sooner this is learned and practiced, the better.

Top management needs to be actively involved in the development and implementation of anti-sexual harassment sensitization projects and policies. Delegation of such projects should be discouraged as only a hands on approach would allow the proper implementation of sensitization across the organization.

Anti NMDA Receptor Encephalitis 

Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis is occurs when the immune system mistakenly targets neurons in the brain, causing inflammation (encephalitis).
In this form of encephalitis, the body makes antibodies that bind to proteins on the NMDA receptor (GluN1/NR1 subunit). NMDA receptors are located on the outer surfaces of cells called neurons and are important to brain function.

This misdirected immune response causes inflammation and swelling in the brain (encephalitis). The NMDA receptors help neurons communicate. An immune response directed at these receptors can affect thinking, memory, mood, consciousness and breathing. These symptoms can be very serious and get worse over time.

This form of encephalitis affects about one in 1.5 million people. It affects females and males but is more common in females.

Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a treatable autoimmune disorder characterized by prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms that predominantly affects children and young adults. In this review, we discuss the pathogenic mechanisms and immunologic triggers of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and provide an overview of treatment and prognosis of this disorder, with specific focus on the management of common symptoms, complications, and patients during pregnancy. Most patients respond well to first-line treatment and surgical resection of tumors. When first-line immunotherapy fails, second-line immunotherapy can often improve outcomes. In addition, treatment with immunomodulators and tumor resection are effective treatment strategies for pregnant patients. Benzodiazepines are the preferred treatment for patients with catatonia, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered when pharmacological treatment is ineffective.

Although the majority of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis achieve favorable outcomes, those who received delayed or insufficient immunotherapy consistently experienced worse outcomes and were more prone to relapse. There is a need for sensitive diagnostic methods to enable early identification of this disease. In addition, current treatment strategies focus primarily on removal of antibodies in the periphery. However, antibodies present in the central nervous system are responsible for disease pathogenesis, which may explain why patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis often require long hospital stays. Some drugs, such as bortezomib, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil have been reported to be beneficial for patients who do not respond to tumor resection and immunosuppressive therapy; however, the effects of these medications have not been systematically verified in large cohorts. Additional studies are required to identify more effective treatment strategies. For patients with long-term sequelae, appropriate rehabilitation methods and improved strategies for the prevention of and monitoring for relapse are of critical importance.

Digital Mental Health (Part 2) Effectiveness, Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions

Deloitte currently projects the global spending on mobile mental health apps alone will amount to almost $500 million in 2022, up from less than $300 million in 2021. And we can anticipate the total market for software solutions for mental conditions will be even larger. The global market for mental health software was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020, and it's expected to reach $4.5 billion by 2026. There is a huge market for digital mental health. 

Digital tools are transforming mental health care. The promise of this transformation to improve outcomes has not yet been realized fully. Digital mental health refers to services targeting mental health problems via online and mobile technologies. Digital mental health enthusiast claim that by using modern technology we can prevent and provide treatment for anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions. 

The prevalence of mental illness varies from 10-20% across the globe. Treatment gap varies from 70 to 80% across the developing world. 
To address these treatment gaps, a range of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been developed over the past 25‚Äâyears. These interventions have been developed to offer an alternative to traditionally delivered mental health interventions, and may be more accessible and acceptable to some individuals. 

Digital intervention tools are already commonplace in the self-management of general mental health, and in the clinical care for people with both chronic physical and mental ill-health. This is not surprising given the ubiquitous permeation of digital technologies in most people‚Äôs lives in the developed world today. Policy makers have also recognised the need to leverage digital technologies in public health system for improving the health system.

Despite the possibility of effective, implementable digital tools, it is unwise to dismiss the potential risks of digital interventions. The concerns regarding privacy and confidentiality regarding digital media also extend to digital health interventions. 

Many are also concerned about the harmful impacts of digital technologies, especially among adolescents, and the risks of entrenching their screen use by offering digital modalities of care. This is not surprising given the increasing complexity of artificial intelligence systems driving commercial digital media. Given the emerging data on the risk of mental ill-health from the use of social media, it is vital to monitor risks for each patient and at a population level with further research. 

Reviews of mobile mental health apps have found that the majority of commercially available apps do not include a privacy policy or terms of agreement, the reading level of existing written policies is frequently inaccessible to the general population and many of the existing privacy policies state that users‚Äô information may be shared with third parties

Digital Mental Health that include human support are often more effective than self-guided or automated treatments. As the world continues to struggle with crises and accessibility, a number and variety of mental health tech solutions arises. This may just be the beginning of a new chapter in exciting new mental health tech solutions and challenges.

CCTV cameras in Healthcare Establishments (CCTV cameras in hospitals - ethical and legal issues)

Most medical care facilities are currently using CCTV cameras to monitor activity in the public sections of their buildings. Relatives of the patients have been continually seeking video surveillance in private patient care settings. Some relatives even have hidden cameras set up. At the same time violence against healthcare professionals also mandates CCTV monitoring. Both for public and healthcare professionals perspective.

The use of CCTV in these environments poses a significant issue with the privacy of patients and staff. Whether the individual being filmed is in a position to give consent for CCTV surveillance is another concern for the health care institution. Although the individual may not be able to contribute on matters relating to their treatment and financial arrangements, a patient‚Äôs competence is not easy to establish. The patient may still be capable of deciding whether to use CCTV surveillance even though that person is not competent enough to make every one of his or her judgments.

A camera that was supposed to track one individual who has given consent to its use may also incidentally record another resident who hasn‚Äôt consented. Based on context, this could very easily lead to an invasion of privacy claim being filed. Health service provision centers should make sure that the relevant state agencies have been informed that this type of information is being compiled and stored periodically. They should review and ensure that relevant policies and regulations are in effect as outlined above and that adequate measures are in place to ensure adherence to privacy and security.

In India, the use of CCTV cameras is governed by the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 under the Information Technology Act, 2000. According to these rules, organizations are required to inform individuals about the collection, storage, and usage of their personal information, and obtain their consent for the same. Additionally, organizations are also required to put in place reasonable security practices and procedures to protect this information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, there are certain exceptions to these rules. For example, the use of CCTV cameras is allowed in public places without the consent of individuals, as long as the cameras are not pointed at areas where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as washrooms or changing rooms. Furthermore, the use of CCTV cameras is also allowed for the protection of the safety and security of individuals and property, as well as for the prevention, detection, and investigation of any crime. In such cases, the collected footage can be shared with law enforcement agencies as per the requirement under the law of the land.

There have been several cases in India where the installation of CCTV cameras in public places or in classrooms without the consent of individuals or parents has been challenged, and the courts have ruled that such installation is a violation of privacy rights. This highlights the need for clear guidelines and specific legislation to regulate the use of CCTV cameras in India, and the importance of balancing the protection of safety and security with the protection of individuals' privacy rights. 

In 2020, in the case of "Justice K.S Puttaswamy (Retd) & Anr v Union of India & Ors", the Supreme Court of India upheld the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution. The court noted that the State will have to take all possible measures to protect the data from being stolen or tampered with, and that it is mandatory for the State to disclose the information to the citizens. 

It is important to note that the use of CCTV cameras should be in compliance with the Right to Privacy under the Indian Constitution. It's also mandatory to display the signs of CCTV surveillance at the entry and exit points of the hospital premises where the cameras are installed. In summary, while the use of CCTV cameras is allowed in India, hospitals must obtain consent from individuals before collecting, storing, and using their personal information, and must put in place reasonable security practices and procedures to protect this information. However, certain exceptions apply, such as in public places or for the protection of safety and security. Overall, the history of CCTV camera laws in India shows that there is a need for a balance between the protection of safety and security and the protection of individuals' privacy rights, and the need for clear guidelines and specific legislation to regulate the use of CCTV cameras

To conclude, it is legal to install a CCTV camera in hospitals in India as long as it is not being used to invade the privacy of others or patients or employees

Autoimmune Limbic Encephalitis

Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain with many etiologies. There are several types of encephalitis that are immune mediated, including the classic paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes, often associated with antibodies against intracellular neuronal proteins (onconeuronal proteins), and the encephalitis syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal cell surface/synaptic proteins, often referred to as "autoimmune encephalitis.

Autoimmune limbic encephalitis comprises a group of non-infectious immune-mediated inflammatory disorders of the brain parenchyma often involving the cortical or deep grey matter. It is characterized by rapidly progressive short-term memory loss, psychiatric symptoms and seizures.

Symptoms develop over days or weeks. 

Autoimmune limbic encephalitis is a challenging diagnosis for several reasons. The clinical presentation can mimic various other diseases and, therefore, the differential diagnosis is large. Additionally, radiological features are frequently absent or non-specific in the more common subtypes. Being aware of the ways in which LE can present allows it to be considered as a diagnostic possibility in undifferentiated neuro-psychiatric presentations, which in turn improves treatment outcomes. Ongoing research into the pathogenesis and application of novel radiological techniques will assist in further characterizing these conditions in the future.

Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE), also known as autoimmune encephalitis with predominant limbic involvement, is a rare neurological condition characterized by inflammation of the limbic system in the brain. The limbic system is responsible for controlling emotions, behavior, and memory.

In ALE, the immune system mistakenly targets and attacks healthy brain tissue, leading to inflammation and dysfunction in the limbic system. This autoimmune response is believed to be triggered by the production of autoantibodies, which are antibodies that mistakenly target the body's own tissues.

The exact cause of ALE is not well understood, but it is thought to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In some cases, ALE may be associated with underlying autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis.

The symptoms of ALE can vary from person to person but often include:

1. Memory problems: Short-term memory loss is a common symptom, and some individuals may experience difficulties forming new memories.

2. Behavioral and personality changes: These can range from mood swings, irritability, and agitation to more severe psychiatric symptoms like psychosis or hallucinations.

3. Seizures: About half of individuals with ALE experience seizures, which may be focal or generalized.

4. Cognitive impairments: Difficulties with attention, language, and executive functions can occur, affecting a person's ability to think, reason, and plan.

5. Sleep disturbances: Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, or abnormal sleep-wake cycles may be present.

6. Neurological abnormalities: Some individuals may exhibit motor abnormalities, such as abnormal movements or coordination difficulties.

Diagnosis of ALE involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes a detailed medical history, neurological examination, blood tests to check for autoimmune markers, brain imaging (MRI), and an electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess brain wave activity. Additionally, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) may be performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of specific antibodies.

Treatment for ALE typically involves immunotherapy to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation in the brain. This may include the use of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), plasma exchange (plasmapheresis), and immunosuppressive medications such as rituximab or cyclophosphamide. In some cases, additional therapies like antiepileptic drugs, psychiatric medications, and supportive care may be necessary.

The prognosis of ALE can vary depending on several factors, including the underlying cause, severity of symptoms, and promptness of treatment. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for better outcomes. With appropriate immunotherapy, many individuals with ALE experience significant improvement in their symptoms, although some may have residual cognitive or behavioral deficits. Regular follow-up with a neurologist is important to monitor the condition and adjust treatment as needed.

Serotonin syndrome 

Serotonin syndrome also referred to as serotonin toxicity, is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. It is seen with therapeutic medication use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning. 

Serotonin syndrome may involve a spectrum of clinical findings, which often include mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are perhaps the most commonly implicated group of medications associated with serotonin syndrome. Notably, SSRIs are less commonly associated with causing severe serotonin syndrome compared with medications that inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).

The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome is made solely on clinical grounds. Therefore, a detailed history and thorough physical and neurologic examinations are essential.

Serotonin syndrome encompasses a spectrum of disease where the intensity of clinical findings is thought to reflect the degree of serotonergic activity. 

Mental status changes can include anxiety, restlessness, disorientation, and agitated delirium.. Patients may startle easily. Autonomic manifestations can include diaphoresis, tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

Neuromuscular hyperactivity can manifest as tremor, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and bilateral Babinski sign. Hyperreflexia and clonus are particularly common; these findings, as well as rigidity, are more often pronounced in the lower extremities. 

In severe cases, muscle rigidity may mask myoclonus and hyperreflexia. While uncommon, fatal cases of serotonin syndrome are associated with hyperthermia and seizure, the latter of which is often a preterminal event 

Physical examination ‚Äî Typical vital sign abnormalities include tachycardia and hypertension, but severe cases may develop hyperthermia and dramatic swings in pulse and blood pressure. Dilated pupils, Tremor, Akathisia, Deep tendon hyperreflexia, Inducible or spontaneous muscle clonus, Muscle rigidity & Bilateral Babinski signs.

The differential diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), anticholinergic toxicity, malignant hyperthermia, intoxication from sympathomimetic agents, sedative-hypnotic withdrawal, meningitis, and encephalitis.

Serotonin syndrome is a clinical diagnosis; serum serotonin concentrations do not correlate with clinical findings, and no laboratory test confirms the diagnosis

Five principles are central to the management of serotonin syndrome:

1. Discontinuation of all serotonergic agents

2. Supportive care aimed at normalization of vital signs

3. Sedation with benzodiazepines

4. Administration of serotonin antagonists

5. Assessment of the need to resume use of causative serotonergic agents after resolution of symptoms

Antidote - Cyproheptadine is available in 4 mg tablets or 2 mg/5 mL syrup. When administered as an antidote for serotonin syndrome, an initial dose of 12 mg is recommended, followed by 2 mg every two hours until clinical response is seen. Cyproheptadine is only available in an oral form, but it may be crushed and given through a nasogastric or orogastric tube.

 Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system due to serotonergic agent therapeutic use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, and intentional self-poisoning

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)

NMS is a life-threatening psychiatric emergency associated with the use of antipsychotic (neuroleptic) agents. This is a , idiosyncratic reaction to the exposure of antipsychotics. It is characterized by a distinctive clinical syndrome of mental status change, rigidity, fever, and autonomic instability.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome , which occurs in approximately 0.2% of patients receiving neuroleptics

Symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually include very high fever (102 to 104 degrees F), irregular pulse, accelerated heartbeat (tachycardia), increased rate of respiration (tachypnea), muscle rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic nervous system dysfunction resulting in high or low blood pressure, profuse perspiration, and excessive sweating.

Other symptoms may include liver or kidney failure, abnormally high potassium levels (hyperkalemia), major destruction of skeletal muscle tissue (rhabdo-myolysis) or blood clots in veins and arteries.

The cause of NMS is unknown. Current theories are limited in their ability to explain all clinical manifestations and in supporting data. The dopamine receptor blockade is central to most theories of its pathogenesis. Central dopamine receptor blockade in the hypothalamus may cause hyperthermia and other signs of dysautonomia. Interference with nigrostriatal dopamine pathways may lead to parkinsonian-type symptoms such as rigidity and tremor.. Other neurotransmitter systems (gamma aminobutyric acid, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine) also appear to be involved, either directly or indirectly.

A genetic basis for the disorder is suspected but not proven. It does appear to be clear that a defect in the receptors to dopamine (dopamine D2 receptor antagonism) is an important contributor to the cause of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 


Diagnosis:

The diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is based on the presence of characteristics that include treatment with neuroleptic drugs within the past 1-4 weeks. high body temperature (greater than 38 degrees centigrade); muscle rigidity; and at least five of the following:

Change in mental status

Rapid heart beat (tachycardia)

Low or high blood pressure (hypo- or hypertension)

Excessive sweating (diaphoresis)

Excessive saliva production (sialorrhea)

Tremor

Incontinence

Increased creatine phosphokinase, or increased urinary myoglobin

Increased number of white blood cells (leukocytosis)

Increased concentrations of metabolic acids in blood and urine

Exclusion of other drug-induced psychiatric or systemic illness.

Treatment

Treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome consists of withdrawal of
neuroleptic medications under a doctor's supervision, immediate measures to restore appropriate water and nutrient levels, and steps to lower the individual's body temperature. Medications prescribed as treatment may include skeletal muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene; stimulators of dopamine production and activity, such as bromocriptine; and/or continuous perfusion of central nervous system depressants, such as diazepam.

Complications that may result from neuroleptic malignant syndrome, such as kidney (renal) insufficiency, deficiency of oxygen reaching the tissues (hypoxia), and/or decreased alkalinity of the blood and tissues (acidosis) can be extremely serious and must be treated immediately. Once patients have recovered from neuroleptic malignant syndrome, about 87% will be able to tolerate an antipsychotic at some point in the future. Physicians usually switch to a different antipsychotic class and to an atypical antipsychotic. Such patients must be carefully monitored since recurrences of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are not infrequent.

Electroconvulsive treatments have been prescribed for patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome with varied results.

Autism in Adults [Autism Spectrum Disorder in Adults] 

Autism is a neuro-developmental condition that affects how the brain processes information. Autistic people have a wide range of strengths, weaknesses, skills and challenges.

Common characteristics include:

difficulties interpreting social rules and body language, which can lead to confusion or misunderstandings
difficulty in forming and maintaining friendships
a tendency to take things literally, which can lead to communication difficulties.
Although autism cannot be cured, appropriate intervention and support can help people to develop skills and coping strategies. Social skills support can assist autistic people in understanding how to read the different expectations of social situations.

Counselling or psychological therapy can help autistic people to understand and regulate their emotions.

Diagnosis of autism in adults

It is not unusual for autistic people to have reached adulthood without a diagnosis. Sometimes people will read some information or see something about autism that makes them think ‚ÄòThat sounds like me.‚Äô They may then choose to talk to a health professional for a diagnosis, or they may not.

An autistic person may find it hard to understand the emotions of other people. Emotions are interpreted by subtle messages sent by facial expression, eye contact and body language. These are often missed or misinterpreted by an autistic person. Because of this, autistic people might be mistakenly perceived as being rude or unfeeling. Autistic people may find it difficult to understand how others perceive their behaviour.

Parents and doctors sometimes miss the symptoms of autism in children who are ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù It‚Äôs also common for autism in children to be misdiagnosed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) since ADHD can also cause difficulty with communication skills and repetitive behavior

Autism symptoms in adults tend to be most prominent in communication skills, interests, emotional and behavioral patterns, and sensitivity to stimuli, such as noise and touch.

Some autism research suggests that most people diagnosed with ASD as adults, do not have the more severe forms. Mild autism has also been referred to as asperger‚Äôs syndrome and high functioning autism.

Mild autism would normally be referred to as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rather than a stand-alone diagnosis. This is because the current criteria, according to the diagnostic and statistical manual (DSM-5), autism spectrum disorders are a spectrum of symptoms, severity and frequency. Mild autism would fall into that category.

Many adults diagnosed with ASD fall under the criteria for so-called mild autism. They may struggle with social interaction more than the general population. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder could grant them access to support services including occupational therapy, physical therapy and other services with a healthcare professional.

Will Artificial Intelligence replace Healthcare Professionals? Will Artificial Intelligence replace Healthcare Professionals? Chat GPT will it replace doctors?

Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems or machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI aims to simulate intelligent behavior and capabilities, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and approaches, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, expert systems, and robotics. These techniques enable AI systems to analyze and interpret large amounts of data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to changing circumstances.

Machine learning is a crucial component of AI and involves training algorithms on data to enable the system to learn and improve its performance without explicit programming. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

AI has the potential to significantly impact healthcare, but it is unlikely to completely replace healthcare professionals. Instead, AI technologies are more likely to augment the work of healthcare professionals and improve the overall quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery. Here are a few reasons why complete replacement is unlikely:

1. Human Interaction and Empathy: Healthcare involves a high degree of human interaction and empathy, which is essential for patient care. While AI can assist in data analysis, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations, it cannot replicate the human touch and emotional support provided by healthcare professionals.

2. Complex Decision-making: Healthcare often involves complex decision-making that requires considering various factors, including medical history, patient preferences, ethical considerations, and social contexts. While AI can provide valuable insights and assist in decision support, final decisions should involve the expertise and judgment of healthcare professionals.

3. Unpredictable Situations: Healthcare professionals often encounter unpredictable situations where adaptability and critical thinking skills are crucial. AI algorithms are typically trained on existing data and may struggle in unfamiliar scenarios or rare conditions. Healthcare professionals are better equipped to handle such situations.

4. Ethical and Legal Considerations: Healthcare decisions often involve ethical dilemmas, privacy concerns, and legal implications. These require human judgment, accountability, and adherence to professional codes of ethics. AI systems must be developed and implemented with careful consideration of these factors.

However, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by assisting with tasks such as image analysis, early detection of diseases, data analysis for personalized medicine, drug discovery, and streamlining administrative tasks. AI technologies can help healthcare professionals make more accurate diagnoses, reduce errors, improve treatment outcomes, and enhance patient care. The collaboration between AI and healthcare professionals is likely to be a synergistic approach that combines the strengths of both for the benefit of patients.

Artificial intelligence cannot replace the role of a Healthcare professional in the emotional and interpersonal aspects of healing a patient. The bond between a Healthcare and patient involves a deep level of emotional connection, care, and nurturing that cannot be replicated by AI.

Role of Healthcare professional encompasses a range of complex and nuanced responsibilities, including providing physical care, emotional support, guidance, and love. They possess a unique understanding of their patient‚Äôs needs, emotions, and individuality that comes from the personal connection and experience of being physically present.

While AI can assist in certain aspects of patient care, such as providing educational content or monitoring certain health parameters, it cannot replace the warmth, empathy, and human touch that a Health care providers can provide. The emotional connection, love, and the ability to adapt to the changing needs of a patient are innate qualities of human healing care that AI cannot replicate.

It's worth noting that AI technologies, such as virtual assistants or educational platforms, can be useful tools that support doctors in an healing journey. They can provide information, resources, and assistance in certain tasks. However, they should be seen as complementary tools rather than replacements for the essential role of a healthcare professionals.

Autism [Autism Spectrum Disorder] Part 2 [ Neurobiology, Assessment, Treatment & Prognosis]

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a diverse group of conditions. They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations.

Available scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors that make a child more likely to have autism, including environmental and genetic factors.

Available epidemiological data conclude that there is no evidence of a causal association between measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, and autism. Previous studies suggesting a causal link were found to be filled with methodological flaws.

There is also no evidence to suggest that any other childhood vaccine may increase the risk of autism. Evidence reviews of the potential association between the preservative thiomersal and aluminium adjuvants contained in inactivated vaccines and the risk of autism strongly concluded that vaccines do not increase the risk of autism.

Assessment and care

A broad range of interventions, from early childhood and across the life span, can optimize the development, health, well-being and quality of life of autistic people. Timely access to early evidence-based psychosocial interventions can improve the ability of autistic children to communicate effectively and interact socially. The monitoring of child development as part of routine maternal and child health care is recommended.

It is important that, once autism has been diagnosed, children, adolescents and adults with autism and their carers are offered relevant information, services, referrals, and practical support, in accordance with their individual and evolving needs and preferences.

The health-care needs of people with autism are complex and require a range of integrated services, that include health promotion, care and rehabilitation. Collaboration between the health sector and other sectors, particularly education, employment and social care, is important.

Interventions for people with autism and other developmental disabilities need to be designed and delivered with the participation of people living with these conditions. Care needs to be accompanied by actions at community and societal levels for greater accessibility, inclusivity and support.

Because there can be overlap in symptoms between ASD and other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it's important that treatment focus on a person's specific needs, rather than the diagnostic label.

No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal of treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing autism spectrum disorder symptoms and supporting development and learning. Early intervention during the preschool years can help your child learn critical social, communication, functional and behavioral skills.

The range of home-based and school-based treatments and interventions for autism spectrum disorder can be overwhelming, and your child's needs may change over time. Your health care provider can recommend options and help identify resources in your area.

If your child is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, talk to experts about creating a treatment strategy and build a team of professionals to meet your child's needs.

Treatment options may include:

Behavioral management therapy
Cognitive behavior therapy
Early intervention
Educational and school-based therapies
Joint attention therapy
Medication treatment
Nutritional therapy
Occupational therapy
Parent-mediated therapy
Physical therapy
Social skills training
Speech-language therapy
If you have a question about treatment, talk to a health care provider who specializes in caring for people with ASD

Ethical Issues in Forensic Psychiatry [Dual Role] Law and Psychiatry

Forensic Psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry in which scientific and clinical expertise is applied in legal contexts involving civil, criminal, correctional, regulatory or legislative matters, and in specialized clinical consultations in areas such as risk assessment or employment. 

The practice of forensic psychiatry often presents significant problems regarding confidentiality. Psychiatrists should be aware of and alert to those issues of privacy and confidentiality presented by the particular forensic situation. Notice of reasonably anticipated limitations to confidentiality should be given to evaluees, third parties, and other appropriate individuals. Psychiatrists should indicate for whom they are conducting the examination and what they will do with the information obtained. At the beginning of a forensic evaluation, care should be taken to explicitly inform the evaluee that the psychiatrist is not the evaluee‚Äôs ‚Äúdoctor.‚Äù Psychiatrists have a continuing obligation to be sensitive to the fact that although a warning has been given, the evaluee may develop the belief that there is a treatment relationship. Psychiatrists should take precautions to ensure that they do not release confidential information to unauthorized persons.

When a patient is involved in parole, probation, conditional release, or in other custodial or mandatory settings, psychiatrists should be clear about limitations on confidentiality in the treatment relationship and ensure that these limitations are communicated to the patient. Psychiatrists should be familiar with the institutional policies regarding confidentiality. When no policy exists, psychiatrists should attempt to clarify these matters with the institutional authorities and develop working guidelines.

Psychiatrists who take on a forensic role for patients they are treating may adversely affect the therapeutic relationship with them. Forensic evaluations usually require interviewing corroborative sources, exposing information to public scrutiny, or subjecting evaluees and the treatment itself to potentially damaging cross-examination. The forensic evaluation and the credibility of the practitioner may also be undermined by conflicts inherent in the differing clinical and forensic roles. Treating psychiatrists should therefore generally avoid acting as an expert witness for their patients or performing evaluations of their patients for legal purposes.

Treating psychiatrists appearing as ‚Äúfact‚Äù witnesses should be sensitive to the unnecessary disclosure of private information or the possible misinterpretation of testimony as ‚Äúexpert‚Äù opinion. In situations when the dual role is required or unavoidable (such as Workers‚Äô Compensation, disability evaluations, civil commitment, or guardianship hearings), sensitivity to differences between clinical and legal obligations remains important.

Autism [Autism Spectrum Disorder] Part 1 [Diagnosis, Prevalence and Comorbidity] 

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a diverse group of conditions. They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty with transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations.

The abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require life-long care and support. Autism often has an impact on education and employment opportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant. Societal attitudes and the level of support provided by local and national authorities are important factors determining the quality of life of people with autism.

Characteristics of autism may be detected in early childhood, but autism is often not diagnosed until much later.

People with autism often have co-occurring conditions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as challenging behaviours such as difficulty sleeping and self-injury. The level of intellectual functioning among autistic people varies widely, extending from profound impairment to superior levels.

Epidemiology

It is estimated that worldwide about 1 in 100 children has autism. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies. Some well-controlled studies have, however, reported figures that are substantially higher. The prevalence of autism in many low- and middle-income countries is unknown.

Autism ‚Äì also referred to as autism spectrum disorder Ã∂ constitutes a diverse group of conditions related to development of the brain.

Evidence-based psychosocial interventions can improve communication and social skills, with a positive impact on the well-being and quality of life of both autistic people and their caregivers.

Care for people with autism needs to be accompanied by actions at community and societal levels for greater accessibility, inclusivity and support.

Medical comorbidities are more common in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) than in the general population. Some genetic disorders are more common in children with ASD such as Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis type I, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Children with autism are also more prone to a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, migraine/headaches, and congenital abnormalities of the nervous system. Besides, sleep disorders are a significant problem in individuals with autism, occurring in about 80% of them. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are significantly more common in children with ASD; they occur in 46% to 84% of them. The most common GI problems observed in children with ASD are chronic constipation, chronic diarrhoea, gastroesophageal reflux and/or disease, nausea and/or vomiting, flatulence, chronic bloating, abdominal discomfort, ulcers, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, food intolerance, and/or failure to thrive. Several categories of inborn-errors of metabolism have been observed in some patients with autism including mitochondrial disorders, disorders of creatine metabolism, selected amino acid disorders, disorders of folate or B12 metabolism, and selected lysosomal storage disorders. A significant proportion of children with ASD have evidence of persistent neuroinflammation, altered inflammatory responses, and immune abnormalities. Anti-brain antibodies may play an important pathoplastic mechanism in autism. Allergic disorders are significantly more common in individuals with ASD from all age groups. They influence the development and severity of symptoms.

Mental Healthcare Act, 2017

There is no health without mental health. Recently conducted National Mental Health Survey quoted a prevalence of 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% current mental morbidity. To address this mammoth problem, an aspirational law was enacted titled ‚ÄúMental Healthcare Act, 2017‚Äù (MHCA 2017). The act is progressive and rights based in nature. 

The preamble of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 promises to provide mental healthcare and services for persons with mental illness (PMI) and to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of such persons during delivery of mental healthcare and service

The heart and soul of this legislation are in Chapter 5 which safeguards the patients‚Äô right to access a range of mental healthcare facilities (such as inpatient and outpatient services; rehabilitation services in the hospital, community, and home; halfway homes; sheltered accommodation; and supported accommodation). If the services are not available, PMI are entitled to compensation from the state. Right to community living, right to confidentiality, right to access medical records, right to protection from cruelty and inhumane treatment, and right to equality and nondiscrimination are all ensured by the law. The act seeks to ensure that mental healthcare facilities are available to all. Those below the poverty line, whether in possession of BPL (below poverty line) card or not, the destitute, and the homeless will be entitled to free mental health treatment. The act provides the right to confidentiality and protection from cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, in addition to the right to live in a community and avail free legal aid. It bans electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without anesthesia and any type of ECT to children and restricts psychosurgery. However, the act mainly focuses on the rights of the persons with mental illness (PMI), only during treatment in hospital but is not equally emphatic about continuity of treatment in the community. The act fails to acknowledge and foster the role and contribution of family members in providing care to PMI. Although there are many positive aspects to the MHCA 2017, it may impact adversely on the mental health care in India. This article focuses on the shortcomings and challenges of the act and also makes attempts to offer alternatives considering the available resources and ground reality. Concepts such as ‚ÄúAdvance directives‚Äù and ‚ÄúNominated representatives‚Äù appear to be very attractive, idealistic, and aspirational, but not evidenced based in the Indian context considering the resources.

It is prudent for the lawmaker to account for the culture of the land, newer scientific developments in the mental health field, analyze the met-unmet needs of the patients and families, and make provisions to bridge the treatment gap. There is also a need to make provisions to enhance the resources and skill building among professionals/workers in the field of mental health, to provide comprehensive healthcare services, to promote mental health and well-being, and to make provisions for adequate financial support/budget (for plan and nonplan expenditures). The need of the hour is a law that can be implemented in practice and can cater to the health needs at all levels of prevention (primary, secondary, and tertiary) while also protecting the rights of the family, professionals, and end users.

To better the access to quality mental health counselling and care services, a ‚ÄòNational Tele Mental Health Programme‚Äô will be launched,‚Äù said the Hon‚Äôble minister in her budget speech in Parliament.While explaining about the National Tele-mental health programme, Hon‚Äôble minister said that this programme will include 23 tele-mental health centres of excellence. Bangalore based National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) will work as its nodal centre and International Institute of Information Technology- Bangalore (IIITB) will provide the necessary technological support, she added.

Union Health Minister Dr. Mansukh Mandviya took to Twitter and thanked PM Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman for announcing this initiative. ‚ÄúWith a network of 23 tele-mental health Centres of Excellence under NIMHANS, it will ensure quality mental health counseling for all,‚Äù Dr. Mandviya tweeted.

 Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)will play a crucial role in implementation of Telemanas. The MoHFW formed a National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) and three technical advisory sub-committees (Mental Health Service Delivery, Information Technology Architecture and Health Systems) to achieve specific goals and objectives of Tele MANAS.

Tele MANAS will be organized as a two-tier system. Tier 1 will comprise the State Tele MANAS cells, which includes trained counsellors and mental health specialists. Tier 2 will comprise specialists at District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)/Medical College resources for physical consultation and/or eSanjeevani for audio visual consultation.

Tele-MANAS aims to provide free tele-mental health services all over the country round the clock, particularly catering to people in remote or under-served areas. The programme includes a network of 23 tele-mental health centres of excellence, with NIMHANS being the nodal centre and International Institute of Information Technology-Bangalore (IIITB) providing technology support. Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bengaluru and National Health Systems Resource Centre (NHRSC) will provide the technical support.The Union Government aims to open at least one Tele-MANAS Cell in each State/UT. A toll-free, 24/7 helpline number (14416) has been set up across the country allowing callers to select the language of choice for availing services. Service is also accessible with 1-800-91-4416. The calls would be routed to Tele-MANAS cells in the respective state and union territory. Tele-MANAS will be organised in two tier system; Tier 1 comprises of state Tele-MANAS cells which include trained counsellors and mental health specialists. Tier 2 will comprise of specialists at District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)/Medical College resources for physical consultation and/or e-Sanjeevani for audio visual consultation. Presently there are 5 regional coordination centres along with 51 State/UT Tele MANAS cells. The initial rollout providing basic support and counselling through centralized Interactive Voice Response system (IVRS) is being customized for use across all States and UTs. This will not only help in providing immediate mental healthcare services, but also facilitate continuum of care. Specialised care is being envisioned through the programme by linking Tele-MANAS with other services like National tele-consultation service, e-Sanjeevani, Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, mental health professionals, Ayushman Bharat health and wellness centres and emergency psychiatric facilities. Eventually, this will include the entire spectrum of mental wellness and illness, and integrate all systems that provide mental health care

12 Important Tips for Disaster Relief Volunteers (Relief workers) Disaster Response Volunteers

Want to learn & work in a disaster affected community? 

One can become a disaster relief volunteers by becoming a trained as a disaster relief volunteer or an emergency response volunteer. By doing this, you are becoming a proactive member of your community and providing much-needed support to local emergency response agencies during times of need.

One of the most unpredictable, and many times most devastating, things to happen to a country is a natural disaster. Regardless of a country‚Äôs economic or political standing, natural disasters can wreak havoc on a population causing an infinitely long recovery process.

Each scenario is different, but these situations often call for volunteers with a variety of backgrounds to help physically and emotionally rebuild affected communities. Regardless of the particular skillset and background you bring to the table, there‚Äôs a good chance you have something to offer in volunteering abroad in an area affected by a natural disaster.

Disaster response skills needed include first aid, psychological first aid, counselling services, helpline, fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization and disaster medical operations. This is a volunteer opportunity for all interested residents.

Volunteers augment the community‚Äôs response capability by performing roles that require less technical training, allowing professionals to focus on the more highly specialized roles. This means volunteers may respond in multiple venues and hold varied roles throughout a single response.

Disasters can happen at any time and in any place, leaving little time to prepare in the moment. It is crucial that a community prepare for the most likely hazards and risks prior to a disaster. Along with emergency management, law enforcement, government organizations, disaster relief organizations, and many others, volunteers are a valuable part of a disaster response. Volunteers can augment a community‚Äôs ability to respond to disasters by providing additional response capacity through different skills and abilities. With a well-designed plan, you can ensure the most efficient, effective response and recovery by using all available resources, including volunteers.

Right to Health [Right to Healthcare] Legal framework of Right to Health 

The right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Internationally, it was first articulated in the 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO), whose preamble defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. The preamble further states that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition.

The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights also mentioned health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The right to health was again recognized as a human right in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The right to health is relevant to all States: every State has ratified at least one international human rights treaty recognizing the right to health. The right to health is a fundamental part of our human rights and of our understanding of a life in dignity.

As our country is a founder member of the United Nations, it has ratified various international conventions promising to secure Health care right of individuals in society. In Indian Constitution does not expressly recognize the fundamental right to Health.

The term Right to Health is nowhere mentioned in the Indian Constitution yet the Supreme Court has interpreted it as a fundamental right under Right to Life enshrined in Article 21. It is a significant view of the Supreme Court that first it interpreted Right to Health under Part IV i.e., Directive Principles of State Policy and noted that it is the duty of the State to look after the Health of the people at large. In its wider interpretation of Article 21, it was held by the Supreme Court that, the Right to Health is a part and parcel of Right to Life and therefore one of fundamental rights provided under Indian Constitution.

However, Article 21 of the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to life & personal liberty. The expression  life in this article means a life with human dignity & not mere survival or animal existence. It has a much wider meaning which includes right to livelihood, better standard of life, hygienic condition in workplace & leisure.

The Supreme Court in Paschim Bangal Khet Mazdoor Samity case (1996) held that in a welfare state, the primary duty of the government is to secure the welfare of the people and moreover it is the obligation of the government to provide adequate medical facilities for its people.

Also, in its landmark judgment in Parmanand Katara Vs Union Of India (1989), Supreme Court had ruled that every doctor whether at a government hospital or otherwise has the professional obligation to extend his services with due expertise for protecting life

The Apex Court, in Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal, while widening the scope of Article 21 and the government‚Äôs responsibility to provide medical aid to every person in the country, held that in a welfare state, the primary duty of the government is to secure the welfare of the people. Providing adequate medical facilities for the people is an obligation undertaken by the government in a welfare state. The government discharges this obligation by providing medical care to the persons seeking to avail of those facilities

Indian Constitution is concerned, nowhere the term ‚Äòhealth‚Äô or ‚Äòright to health‚Äô has been defined in it. Through Judicial interpretations it has been observed that ‚Äòright to life‚Äô also includes ‚Äòright to health‚Äô and thus it is a fundamental right. But till date it has not been given due recognition for which public interest litigations have been filed frequently on health issues involving fundamental right to health, rights of workers to occupational health and safety, right to clean environment, right to adequate drugs, medical negligence, right against medical malpractice, right to emergency health care, public health care etc. It is high time, let us be united and do the needful to achieve this goal and to live health

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry. They may worry more than seems warranted about actual events or may expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern.

GAD is diagnosed when a person finds it difficult to control worry on more days than not for at least six months

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)  usually involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread that interferes with how you live your life. It is not the same as occasionally worrying about things or experiencing anxiety due to stressful life events. People living with GAD experience frequent anxiety for months, if not years.

GAD develops slowly. It often starts around age 30, although it can occur in childhood. The disorder is more common in women than in men

People with GAD may:

- Worry excessively about everyday things
- Have trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness
- Know that they worry much more than they should
- Feel restless and have trouble relaxing
- Have a hard time concentrating
- Startle easily
- Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
- Tire easily or feel tired all the time
- Have headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, - 
- Unexplained pains
- Tremble or twitch
- Feel irritable or "on edge"
- Feel lightheaded, or feel out of breath

Adults with GAD are often highly nervous about everyday circumstances, such as:

- Job security or performance
- Health
- Finances
- The health and well-being of their children or other family members
- Being late
- Completing household chores and other responsibilities

Treatment of GAD 

A number of types of treatment can help with GAD. Supportive and interpersonal therapy can help. Cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) has been more researched and specifically targets thoughts, physical symptoms and behaviors including the over-preparation, planning and avoidance that characterizes GAD. Mindfulness based approaches and Acceptance Commitment Therapy have also been investigated with positive outcome. All therapies (sometimes in different ways) help people change their relationship to their symptoms. They help people to understand the nature of anxiety itself, to be less afraid of the presence of anxiety, and to help people make choices independent of the presence of anxiety. The adult CBT treatments for GAD have been modified for children and teens and show positive outcomes.

There are a number of medication choices for GAD, usually the SSRIs either alone or in combination with therapy.  

Relaxation techniques, meditation, yoga, exercise, and other alternative treatments may also become part of a treatment plan.

Other anxiety disorders, depression, or substance abuse often accompany GAD, which rarely occurs alone; co-occurring conditions must also be treated with appropriate therapies.

Supportive Psychotherapy [Supportive Therapy]

Supportive psychotherapy functions with the objective of reducing anxiety and maintaining a positive patient-therapist relationship with minimal focus on transference. Supportive psychotherapy occurs in almost every doctor-patient encounter and is the psychotherapy provided to the vast majority of patients who are seen in psychiatric clinics and mental health centers. Yet very few scholarly articles are written that help explain its principles or how it works.

Supportive psychotherapy is a psychotherapeutic approach that integrates various therapeutic schools such as psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral, as well as interpersonal conceptual models and techniques.

The aim of supportive psychotherapy is to reduce or to relieve the intensity of manifested or presenting symptoms, distress or disability. It also reduces the extent of behavioral disruptions caused by the patient's psychic conflicts or disturbances. Unlike in psychoanalysis, in which the analyst works to maintain a neutral demeanor as a "blank canvas" for transference, in supportive therapy the therapist engages in a fully emotional, encouraging, and supportive relationship with the patient as a method of furthering healthy defense mechanisms, especially in the context of interpersonal relationships.

Most psychotherapies rely on the therapeutic alliance, but in supportive psychotherapy it is considered the most important element. When practicing supportive psychotherapy, one must negotiate a therapeutic alliance that preserves the authority, voice, and agency of the patient and ensures that he or she is active in the treatment. In patients who have chronic disorders, unsatisfactory living conditions, and little hope for change in their lives, the therapist represents a figure of stability, a contact with the outside world, and a representative of the broader world. Supportive psychotherapy stands in contrast to expressive therapies that seek to accomplish personality change through analysis of the relationship; exploration of previously unrecognized feelings, thoughts, needs, and conflicts; and development of insight. Supportive therapy includes some of these elements, so the therapist must move through a ‚Äúpsychotherapeutic continuum‚Äù 

Supportive psychotherapy can be used as treatment for a variety of physical, mental, and emotional ailments, and consists of a variety of strategies and techniques in which therapists or other licensed professionals can treat their patients. The objective of the therapist is to reinforce the patient's healthy and adaptive patterns of thought behaviors in order to reduce the intrapsychic conflicts that produce symptoms of mental disorders.

Supportive psychotherapy is often practiced for patients who are considered lower functioning, too fragile, or too unmotivated to participate in more demanding expressive therapy, which might have more chance of leading to personality change.

The therapist takes into account the patient‚Äôs cognitive abilities, reality testing, thought process, capacity to organize behavior, affect regulation, and capacity to relate to others in order to determine the patient‚Äôs location on the continuum. Purely supportive interventions are chosen for patients with disorganized behavior, thought disorder or cognitive impairment, limited intelligence, and lower levels of education and socialization and for patients with personality disorders. With less impaired patients, expressive therapies are used. It is important for the therapist to be hopeful that the impaired patient can eventually move across to more psychodynamic supportive therapy and beyond.

Supportive psychotherapy is possibly the most ubiquitously used psychotherapy but is less researched. Since the beginning, compared to other psychotherapies, it is considered as an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù therapy and is referred to as ‚ÄúCinderella of Psychotherapies,‚Äù which can be used in multitude of clinical scenarios and settings. It can not only be used in outpatient setting but can be used inpatient setting, emergency setup, and consultation-liaison psychiatry setting including medical inpatient and outpatient setups. It is  flexible, can fit and address the needs of a wide range of clients with different diagnoses. Further, it is also often used as the initial form of therapy, before the therapist shifts to a more structured and sophisticated form of psychotherapy.

There is no straight jacket recommendation for carrying out this therapy, and the therapists can choose the techniques to be used, depending on the need of the client. The therapist can draw techniques from various other schools of thoughts, if they feel that, an eclectic mix of techniques will help a client.

Preprinted Consent Form [ Vinod Khanna vs R. G. Stone Urology Hospital 2018 ] 

Every transaction to be legal requires consent amongst entities capable of giving so. Else the transaction is, generally, void or voidable at the peril of one party or another.

 Consent in Medical situations, however, is a more complicated matter. To begin with the two parties are unequally placed. On one side is a patient, in need of succor and help , and not aware of what is wrong with him or her. On the other side is a Doctor, an expert in his/ her field, and capable of giving the succor that the patient desperately needs. Informed consent is the process in which a health care provider educates a patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a given procedure or intervention. The patient must be competent to make a voluntary decision about whether to undergo the procedure or intervention.

With this background, the patient is supposed to be explained the treatment recommended and its risks and benefits. This is an ‚ÄòInformed Consent ‚Äòand is (supposed to be) taken from a patient prior to any procedure that may have one or more risks to the patient. 

There are plethora of case laws on the subject of ‚ÄòInformed Consent‚Äô that has evolved over the years, addressing essentially what is proper and valid consent. 

Sometimes, the judicial system intervenes to try to remove those lacunae. One such intervention is a recent judgement by the Honorable National Consumer Disputes Redressed Commission ( NCDRC) . In the case of Vinod Khanna vs R. G. Stone Urology Hospital and Ors ( Consumer Case No. 428 of 2018 ), the Hon‚Äôble NCDRC has ruled that :

‚Äú The use of pre-printed and fixed "informed consent cum undertaking" forms by the hospitals to record consent from the patients amounts to "unfair trade practice" within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.‚Äù

Hon‚Äôble NCDRC observes in the Judgement ( Para 4) :

"However, we cannot ignore the peculiarity of the 'informed consent' in the instant case which needs prompt and proper rectification. It is pertinent to note that it is a pre-printed form- 'informed consent cum undertaking' having blank spaces for limited selective handwritten entries and for the signatures. The main body of the form is fixed pre-printed. Such consent form fits into any procedure, any doctor, and any patient. Thus, it will take shape of informed consent if someone after filling up the blank spaces in handwriting and affixing the signatures of the patient and his sister as witness. This to be administrative arbitrariness and one-sided high handedness, and to be unfair and deceptive, on the part of the OP-1 (hospital); though the complainant has not been prejudiced in this particular case"


What is interesting to note is that the Hon‚Äôble NCRDC found ‚Äòpre-printed consent form with blank spaces for handwritten entries' to be unfair trade practice in this instant case. While no medical negligence per se was found, this conduct invited a cost of Rs. 10 lacs upon the concerned Hospital by the Hon‚Äôble NCDRC.

Euthanasia [Part 2] Common Cause v. Union of India (2023) 24 Jan 2023 Supreme Court Judgment 

In March 2018, a Constitution bench recognized a person‚Äôs right to die with dignity, saying that a terminally ill person can opt for passive euthanasia and execute a living will to refuse medical treatment. It permitted an individual to draft a living will specifying that she or he will not be put on life support if they slip into an incurable coma. However a plea, argued by senior counsel on behalf of the petitioners, who said that the three-step process encompassing onerous conditions has made the entire judgment nugatory, and that there has not been a single case where someone desirous of exercising the right to passive euthanasia could finally comply with the procedural requirements. While hearing this plea, the bench acknowledged that the 2018 judgment needed a ‚Äúlittle tweaking‚Äù to make it workable.


The Supreme Court on 24 Jan 2023 revamped the ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù procedure impeding the execution of passive euthanasia, laying down a definite timeline for medical experts, and cutting the red tape involved in the preparation of a living will by those who want withdrawal of treatment essential to life when they become terminally ill.


A Constitution bench, paved the way for major changes in the guidelines prescribed by the 2018 judgment of the top court, making steps in the process timebound and less complex in recognition of the right to die with dignity. The bench tweaked the previous judgment to do away with the necessity of a judicial magistrate to attest or countersign a living will, and held that an attestation by a notary or a gazetted officer would be sufficient for a person to make a valid living will. Instead of the living will being in the custody of the district court concerned ‚Äî as directed by the court in 2018 ‚Äî the bench said that the document will be a part of the national health digital record which can be accessed by hospitals and doctors from any part of the country. Another crucial change brought about by the bench pertained to the constitution of the primary and secondary board of doctors who would examine the condition of the patient to take a decision whether the instructions given in the advanced directive should be carried out.


While the 2018 judgment said that the primary board should comprise at least four experts from the fields of general medicine, cardiology, neurology, nephrology, psychiatry or oncology ‚Äî with overall standing in the profession for at least 20 years ‚Äî the bench on Tuesday said that a team of three doctors, including the treating physician and two other doctors with five years of experience in the concerned specialty will comprise the primary board.


The primary board will preferably decide within 48 hours on the withdrawal of further treatment, noted the bench. The 2018 judgment did not lay down any outer limit for a decision by the primary board on executing the living will. If the primary medical board certifies that the treatment should be withdrawn in terms of the instructions contained in the living will, the hospital shall immediately constitute a secondary medical board comprising a doctor nominated by the chief medical officer of the district concerned and two subject experts of the relevant specialty with minimum five years‚Äô standing who were not part of the primary board. Under the 2018 judgment, the district collector concerned had to constitute the second board of medical experts. This board will also decide preferably within 48 hours... They may also need to reflect on the conditions or consult others,‚Äù said the bench, adding a 48 hour-deadline appears to be reasonable in such cases. There was no timeline specified secondary medical board in the 2018 judgment.


After both the boards approve the execution of the living will, the jurisdictional magistrate will be immediately intimated about the decision, said the bench.


If the hospital‚Äôs medical board denies permission to withdraw medical treatment, the family members of the patient can approach the relevant high court, which forms a fresh board of medical experts to enable the court take a final call.


While those making the living will specify the executors of their will for the consent on the behalf of the terminally ill patients, the family members of other terminally ill patients can also make a decision on withdrawal of treatment subject to the safeguards and the procedure mentioned for those who did not ready advanced directives.

How to write a Thesis? [Part-2] Dissertation 

A thesis or dissertation is a long piece of academic writing based on original research, submitted as part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree.

Most research begins with a question. Think about which topics and theories you are interested in and what you would like to know more about. Think about the topics and theories you have studied in your program

The structure of a dissertation depends on your field, but it is usually divided into at least four or five chapters (including an introduction and conclusion chapter).

The dissertation may seem like an overwhelming challenge. There are two possible paths to success:

Planning Ahead -  Is the sure path for successful writing and completion of thesis 

Perseverance - Thesis is written in layers and habit of writing consistently leads 

The most common dissertation structure in the sciences and social sciences includes:

- An introduction to your topic
- A literature review that surveys relevant sources
- An explanation of your methodology
- An overview of the results of your research
- A discussion of the results and their implications
- A conclusion that shows what your research has contributed

Microbiota (Gut Microbiota Brain Axis) Gut Brain Axis [Microbiome]

The human microbiota consists of a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other single-celled animals that live in the body.The biggest populations of microbes reside in the gut. Other popular habitats include the skin and genitals. The microorganisms living inside the gastrointestinal tract amount to around 4 pounds of biomass. Every individual has a unique mix of species. The microbiota is important for nutrition, immunity, and effects on the brain and behavior. It is implicated in a number of diseases that cause a disturbance in the normal balance of microbes.

The microbiome is the name given to all of the genes inside these microbial cells. The human genome consists of about 23‚Äâ000 genes, whereas the microbiome encodes over three million genes producing thousands of metabolites, which replace many of the functions of the host. 

The gut microbiota provides essential capacities for the fermentation of non-digestible substrates like dietary fibres and endogenous intestinal mucus. This fermentation supports the growth of specialist microbes that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases. The major SCFAs produced are acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

Every human being harbors anywhere between 10 trillion and 100 trillion microbial cells in a symbiotic relationship. This benefits both the microbes and their hosts, as long as the body is in a healthy state. Estimates vary, but there could be over 1,000 different species of microorganism making up the human microbiota.

Given the current gaps in knowledge, we need clinical evidence that can be translated into clinical practice, ideally through randomised controlled studies that use consistent matrices of prebiotics or probiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation to assess changes in gut microbiota composition and in health outcomes.

Take Home Messages 

Gut microbiota influences many areas of human health from innate immunity to appetite and energy metabolism

Targeting the gut microbiome, with probiotics or dietary fibre, benefits human health and could potentially reduce obesity 

Drugs, food ingredients, antibiotics, and pesticides could all have adverse effects on the gut microbiota

Microbiota should be considered a key aspect in nutrition; the medical community should adapt their education and public health messages

Fiber consumption is associated with beneficial effects in several contexts

External factors can affect your gut microbiota. While some are less controllable (e.g. genetics, delivery methods, geography and aging), you can act on your diet and lifestyle to help your gut microbiota work properly. What you eat doesn‚Äôt only nourish you; it also feeds the trillions of microorganisms that live in your gut. Include prebiotic fibers and fermented foods with probiotics, as you make progress on the path towards a healthy gut. Further understanding of the importance of developing and maintaining gut microbiota diversity may lead to targeted interventions for health promotion, disease prevention and management. Diet, functional foods and gut microbiota transplantation are areas that have yielded some therapeutic success in modulating the gut microbiota, and warrant further investigation of their effects on various disease states.

Planning & Writing A Thesis Protocol. Thesis [Part-1] Dissertation Proposal 

Writing a dissertation or thesis is not a simple task. It takes time, energy, and a lot of dedication to get you across the finish line. It‚Äôs not easy ‚Äì but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be a painful process. If you understand the big-picture process of how to plan and write a dissertation or thesis, your research journey will be a lot smoother.  

A research proposal is born with the intent to convince others that your project is worthy and you are able to manage it with a complete and specific work plan. With a strong idea in mind, it is time to write a document where all the aspects of the future research project must be explained in a precise, understandable manner.

The first drafting of the protocol for a new research project should start from a solid idea with one or more of these goals

1. Overcoming the limits of the current knowledge in a determinate field with the aim of bridging a ‚Äúknowledge gap‚Äù

2. Bringing something new in a scarcely explored field

3. Validating or nullifying previous results obtained in limited records by studies on a wider population.

Here are the points you should include in the proposal:

Dissertation title

Objectives - Aim for up to three objectives. If you're too extensive at this point, it will seem like your plan doesn't have a focus, so you'll need to narrow it down.

Literature - Ask your mentor if you're expected to list some specific references in this section. If that's not the case, you'll at least need to mention the areas of study, schools of thought, and other sources of information you're going to use during the research stage.

Research - This is the main section, where you'll elaborate the ideas of your research question. You will clearly outline the area of research.

Methodology - The dissertation project can be non-empirical (if the resources come from previously published projects) or empirical (if you collect data through questionnaires or other methods). In this section, you need to explain the methods of collecting data.

Potential outcomes - Where do you think you'll end up after all the research and analysis? Explain the outcome you expect to come down to.

Timeframe - Create a schedule that explains how you will manage all stages of dissertation writing within a specific timeframe.

List of references - Ask your mentor if you're supposed to include this part, and he'll provide you with the instructions.

World Autism Awareness Day 2023 [Autism]

The United Nations General Assembly designated a resolution (A/RES/62/139). The council passed ‚ÄòWorld Autism Awareness Day‚Äô on November 1, 2007, and adopted it on December 18, 2007. The purpose was to highlight the need to help improve the quality of life of autistic people. The very first World Autism Day was observed in the year 2008 on April 2.

 The day is observed to raise awareness among its citizens about people with Autism Spectrum Disorder throughout the world. Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication. Autism is a development disorder. The disorder is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication which may also include restricted and repetitive behaviour. The signs of Autism are often noticed by the parents of the child during the first three years. These signs develop gradually

Many autistic adults take the neurodiversity perspective; they seek acceptance and inclusion rather than a cure and prefer the symbolism of diversity and completeness (the infinity sign). Some have a very intense emotional reaction to traditional autism awareness symbolism; it reminds them of feeling like ‚Äúa missing piece,‚Äù a ‚Äútragedy‚Äù that ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù their parents‚Äô dreams. They also prefer identity-first language (autistic person) rather than person-first language (person with autism)

To make the diagnosis, doctors observe the child and ask questions of the parents or guardians about the child‚Äôs behaviors. The diagnosis may be suspected by developmental screens done at 9 months, 18 months and 24 months of age. There is no lab test for an autism spectrum disorder.

The key is to find out as soon as possible if a child is on the spectrum. That way, you can line up resources to help your child reach their full potential. The sooner that starts, the better.

There are medications to help children with symptoms. Medication works best when paired with therapy that develops socialization and other life skills.

Keep in mind that someone who‚Äôs on the spectrum experiences the world differently. Their victories and challenges might be very different from yours. It helps to appreciate them as they are, with their own unique personalities and interests, while you get them the support and skills that could make a big difference in their future

World Health Day 2023 [ Health For All ] 7 April 2023 #HealthForAll

It is celebrated annually and each year draws attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world.

The date of 7 April marks the anniversary of the founding of WHO in 1948

In 1948, countries of the world came together and founded‚ÄØWHO to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable ‚Äì so everyone, everywhere can attain the highest level of health and well-being.‚ÄØ  

WHO‚Äôs 75th‚ÄØanniversary year is an opportunity to look back at public health successes that have improved quality of life during the last seven decades. It is also an opportunity to motivate action to tackle the health challenges of today  Ã∂  and tomorrow.  

Join WHO on a journey to achieve Health For All.

Health For All is a goal of the World Health Organization (WHO), that has been popularized since the 1970s and which envisions securing the health and well being of people around the world. It is the basis for the World Health Organization's primary health care strategy to promote health, human dignity, and enhanced quality of life.

Health For All means that health is to be brought within reach of everyone in a given country. And by "health" is meant a personal state of well being, not just the availability of health services ‚Äì a state of health that enables a person to lead a socially and economically productive life. Health For All implies the removal of the obstacles to health ‚Äì that is to say, the elimination of malnutrition, ignorance, contaminated drinking water and unhygienic housing ‚Äì quite as much as it does the solution of purely medical problems such as a lack of doctors, hospital beds, drugs and vaccines.

Health does not exist in isolation. It is influenced by a complex of environmental, social, and economic factors ultimately related to each other. The health of the poor is largely the result of a combination of unemployment (and underemployment), poverty, a low level of education, poor housing, poor sanitation, malnutrition, and lack of the will and initiative to make changes for the better. It would be unrealistic to expect any substantial health improvements in these populations unless these constraints are first removed or alleviated.

Health For All means that health should be regarded as an objective of economic development and not merely as one of the means of attaining it.

Health For All demands, ultimately, literacy for all. Until this becomes reality it demands at least the beginning of an understanding of what health means for every individual.

Health For All depends on continued progress in medical care and public health. The health services must be accessible to all through primary health care, in which basic medical help is available in every village, backed up by referral services to more specialised care. Immunisation must similarly achieve universal coverage.

Health For All is thus a holistic concept calling for efforts in agriculture, industry, education, housing, and communications, just as much as in medicine and public health. Medical care alone cannot bring health to in hovels. Health for such people requires a whole new way of life and fresh opportunities to provide themselves with a higher standard of living.

The adoption of Health For All by government, implies a commitment to promote the advancement of all citizens on a broad front of development and a resolution to encourage the individual citizen to achieve a higher quality of life.

The rate of progress will depend on the political will. The World Health Assembly believes that, given a high degree of determination, Health For All could be attained by the year 2000. That target date is a challenge to all WHO's Member States.

The confrontations with industry are the most difficult to resolve. The pharmaceutical industry, the infant foods industry, the tobacco industry, the medical equipment industry‚Äîall affect the health of the people, whether negatively or positively or in both ways.

The basis of the Health For All strategy is primary health care.

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is a Sanskrit phrase found in Hindu texts such as the Maha Upanishad, which means "The World Is One Family". Vedic tradition mentions "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" meaning all living beings on the earth are a family.

The theme and the logo for India‚Äôs G20 Presidency from December 1, 2022, till November 30, 2023 has a mention of ‚ÄúVasudhaiva Kutumbakam‚Äù or ‚ÄúOne Earth-One Family-One Future‚Äù. This is nothing but cooperation, coordination, sharing and peace 

Nothing but

Microbiota (Microbiome)

The human microbiota consists of a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other single-celled animals that live in the body. The biggest populations of microbes reside in the gut. Other popular habitats include the skin and genitals. The microorganisms living inside the gastrointestinal tract amount to around 4 pounds of biomass. Every individual has a unique mix of species. The microbiota is important for nutrition, immunity, and effects on the brain and behavior. It is implicated in a number of diseases that cause a disturbance in the normal balance of microbes.

The microbiome is the name given to all of the genes inside these microbial cells. The human genome consists of about 23‚Äâ000 genes, whereas the microbiome encodes over three million genes producing thousands of metabolites, which replace many of the functions of the host. 

The gut microbiota provides essential capacities for the fermentation of non-digestible substrates like dietary fibres and endogenous intestinal mucus. This fermentation supports the growth of specialist microbes that produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases. The major SCFAs produced are acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

Every human being harbors anywhere between 10 trillion and 100 trillion microbial cells in a symbiotic relationship. This benefits both the microbes and their hosts, as long as the body is in a healthy state. Estimates vary, but there could be over 1,000 different species of microorganism making up the human microbiota.

Given the current gaps in knowledge, we need clinical evidence that can be translated into clinical practice, ideally through randomised controlled studies that use consistent matrices of prebiotics or probiotics or faecal microbiota transplantation to assess changes in gut microbiota composition and in health outcomes.

Take Home Messages 

Gut microbiota influences many areas of human health from innate immunity to appetite and energy metabolism

Targeting the gut microbiome, with probiotics or dietary fibre, benefits human health and could potentially reduce obesity 

Drugs, food ingredients, antibiotics, and pesticides could all have adverse effects on the gut microbiota

Microbiota should be considered a key aspect in nutrition; the medical community should adapt their education and public health messages

Fiber consumption is associated with beneficial effects in several contexts

External factors can affect your gut microbiota. While some are less controllable (e.g. genetics, delivery methods, geography and aging), you can act on your diet and lifestyle to help your gut microbiota work properly. What you eat doesn‚Äôt only nourish you; it also feeds the trillions of microorganisms that live in your gut. Include prebiotic fibers and fermented foods with probiotics, as you make progress on the path towards a healthy gut. Further understanding of the importance of developing and maintaining gut microbiota diversity may lead to targeted interventions for health promotion, disease prevention and management. Diet, functional foods and gut microbiota transplantation are areas that have yielded some therapeutic success in modulating the gut microbiota, and warrant further investigation of their effects on various disease states.

Suicide and Attempted Suicide - Legal implications of Deliberate & Abetment of self-harm

Abetment of suicide as Per Indian Penal Code Sec 305 & 306 means, a person abetting the suicide of another person shall be punished with imprisonment for up to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.

A person is guilty of abetment when:

1) He instigates someone to commit suicide (or)
2) He is part of a conspiracy to make a person commit suicide (or)
3) He intentionally helps the victim to commit suicide by doing an act or by not doing something that he was bound to do

Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis (Gut Brain Axis) Microbiota-Brain Axis

The gut‚Äìbrain axis is the two-way biochemical signaling that takes place between the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the central nervous system (CNS). The term "gut‚Äìbrain axis" is occasionally used to refer to the role of the gut microbiota in the interplay as well.

The human microbiota has a fundamental role in host physiology and pathology. Gut microbial alteration, also known as dysbiosis, is a condition associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders but also with diseases affecting other distal organs. 

Recently it became evident that the intestinal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and inflammation. The nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract are communicating through a bidirectional network of signaling pathways called the gut-brain axis, which consists of multiple connections, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, and bacterial metabolites and products. 

During dysbiosis, these pathways are dysregulated and associated with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. However, numerous mechanisms behind the impact of the gut microbiota in neuro-development and -pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There are several immune pathways involved in CNS homeostasis and inflammation. Among those, the inflammasome pathway has been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs diseases, but also anxiety and depressive-like disorders.

Res Ipsa Loquitor [ Medical Negligence ] Medical Malpractice [the thing speaks for itself]

Res Ipsa Loquitur is a Latin phrase that means the thing speaks for itself. In the law of torts, it is a very popular doctrine. In cases, where the evidence is itself sufficient to prove the guilt of the defendant, the maxim is used there. So, the maxim points out any circumstantial evidence or an object which itself shows that an act has been committed. It shows that if the defendant was not negligent, the accident would not have happened.

The maxim Res Ipsa Loquitur is used in cases where the proof or evidence or an object of an accident directly points out towards the guilt of the defendant and shows that defendant himself is the cause of such accident. Mere proof of the accident does not prove the guilt of the defendant and so in such cases, this maxim cannot be used. It is a rule of evidence and not a rule of law.

Elements
To prove a res ipsa loquitur claim, an injured party must show three elements:

1) That the accident was of a sort that does not normally occur without someone‚Äôs negligence

2) That the accident was caused by an instrumentality within the defendant‚Äôs exclusive control and

3) That the accident did not happen due to any voluntary action by the injured party.

Process 

Once you establish negligence in a res ipsa loquitur case, the burden shifts to the defendant to disprove their own negligence. Some defenses that they may use include the following:

a) There are possible alternative causes of the plaintiff‚Äôs injury that are not negligence based
b) The plaintiff may have been partially at fault for what happened
c) The plaintiff did not name all the possible causes of the injury
d) The instrument that caused the injury was not under the defendant‚Äôs exclusive control
e) There are other defendants who could be responsible for the plaintiff‚Äôs injuries

The doctrine is often used for patients to get financial compensation for injuries sustained in a surgical procedure. You do not know what happened when you were under anesthesia. While you may have expert witnesses, they can only do so much to explain why the injury occurred.

Much of the information is under control of the doctor, and they will try to keep it from coming to light because it will make them liable.

When a doctor leaves a surgical instrument in the body, it would be a clear case of res ipsa loquitur. There can be other injuries, that may be unexplained. The fact that they happened, along with expert testimony, could be enough to prove negligence on the part of the doctor.

Like any other personal injury case, you may be entitled to the following damages when you can show negligence through the application of res ipsa loquitur:

- Medical treatment
- Lost wages for time missed from work
- Pain and suffering
- Loss of enjoyment of life
- Scarring and permanent disfigurement
- In some cases, you may even be able to obtain punitive damages in these cases because what happened is so outrageous and extreme

Res ipsa loquitur is a legal doctrine used in personal injury cases to establish that a defendant acted negligently. It allows a judge or jury to presume negligence when the facts of a case show that an accident occurred and there is no other explanation for it but for the defendant‚Äôs acts. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has been adopted by most jurisdictions in India.

Predicting Violence in Persons with Mental illness [Risk Assessment & Management] Part 2 

Risk assessment in mental health facilities aims to determine the extent to which patients are at risk of harm to themselves or others (University of Manchester, 2018). Risk in mental health is defined as the ‚Äúlikelihood of an event happening with potentially harmful or beneficial outcomes for self or others‚Äù (Morgan, 2004). 

Risk assessment plays an important role in management strategies to enhance patient care. Assessment of violence should combine evidence-based risk factors with clinical judgment to identify patients who are at risk for violence (McCallum & Eagle, 2015). 

Risk assessment should be done at regular intervals and include risk screening, risk assessment, and clinical judgment (Fuad 2017). It is recommended that future research explore the combination of risk categories, biological risk factors, and clinical risk factors to develop comprehensive risk assessment tools. 

Risk assessment in the mental health context holds its own risks. Predicting violence accurately is impossible but risk assessment is possible.

Social media and Healthcare Professionals

Social media is designed to connect people. Different people use social media in different ways and we‚Äôre constantly fed mixed messages about using social media. Some use it solely in a professional capacity while others use it personally, and many use a mix of the two. 

Awareness of social media and its use in healthcare has become more established in recent years. Easy access and availability of communication tools have enabled more efficient communication of doctors within and outside of their practice. While this has created more opportunities for collaboration, it is not without its challenges. Social media has made it more difficult for physicians to maintain a clear boundary line between their professional and personal lives. Healthcare workers have been disciplined for inappropriate online postings. This video discusses the use of social media by healthcare professionals. 

The use of social media by the medical profession is common and growing. It has changed the way we can communicate with each other and the wider community. We can now share information, create content, have meaningful social interactions, and collaborate in real-time for professional and personal benefits. However, social media has the potential to blur the boundaries between private and professional.

There can be immense professional benefits by having an active presence through the proper use of social media, but inappropriate online behaviour has the potential to undermine professional integrity, doctor-patient and doctor-colleague relationships, future employment opportunities, and public trust and confidence in the medical profession. 

Doctors have a responsibility to ensure that their use of social media is consistent with their ethical and legal obligations to protect patient confidentiality. It is important to remember that breaches of patient confidentiality online can have far wider implications because of the reach of social media and permanency of digital information

Maintaining patient confidentiality upholds the public‚Äôs trust in the medical profession and maintains our ability to treat patients effectively. Breaching confidentiality can result in complaints to your employer or medical registration authority

Be aware that any material posted online, even anonymously can be traced to the original author.
Exercise sound judgement when posting online and avoid making gratuitous or unsubstantiated
comments about individuals or organisations. This could be viewed as a breach of your professional obligations under the regulatory authority and be subject to allegations of bullying.

Professional codes of conduct specify that doctors should not engage in behaviours that can harm the reputation of colleagues or the profession. Defamation is the communication or publication of false information about a person or certain organisations that damages their reputation. Material posted online by individuals or organisations that are false, untrue, misleading or deceptive can have significant legal and financial consequences. 

If you are posting as a healthcare professional,  my advice is to avoid posting anonymously and to use your own name.  Closed groups can be useful in bringing together people with a common interest and can create a sense of community. Respect patient privacy and follow HIPAA rules and guidelines, as well as other state and federal regulations governing your profession. Don‚Äôt engage in an online battle. Don‚Äôt cross professional boundaries. Don‚Äôt post material that infringes on the rights of any third party

Predicting Violence in Persons with Mental Illness [Process of risk Assessment] Part - 3

The assessment of clinical risk in mental healthcare is challenging but provides an opportunity to engage with patients, and their carers and families in order to promote the patients‚Äô safety, recovery and wellbeing
 
A good risk assessment will combine consideration of mental status, severity of illness, environmental factors, family factors and social factors (e.g. relationship problems, employment status) as part of a comprehensive review of the patient to capture their care needs and assess their risk of harm to themselves or other people.

Risk assessment in mental health facilities aims to determine the extent to which patients are at risk of harm to themselves or others (University of Manchester, 2018). Risk in mental health is defined as the ‚Äúlikelihood of an event happening with potentially harmful or beneficial outcomes for self or others‚Äù (Morgan, 2004). 

Risk assessment plays an important role in management strategies to enhance patient care. Assessment of violence should combine evidence-based risk factors with clinical judgment to identify patients who are at risk for violence (McCallum & Eagle, 2015). 

Risk assessment should be done at regular intervals and include risk screening, risk assessment, and clinical judgment (Fuad 2017). It is recommended that future research explore the combination of risk categories, biological risk factors, and clinical risk factors to develop comprehensive risk assessment tools. 

Risk assessment in the mental health context holds its own risks. Predicting violence accurately is impossible but risk assessment is possible.

Risk is not a number, and risk assessment is not a checklist. Tools if they are used (for example as a prompt or a measure of change) need to be simple, accessible, and should be considered part of a wider assessment process. Treatment decisions should not be determined by a score.

There is a growing consensus that risk tools and scales have little place on their own in the prevention of suicide. This study suggests ways in which clinical risk assessment processes might be improved; by placing the emphasis on clinical judgement and building relationships, and by gathering good information on (i) the current situation, (ii) history of risk, and (iii) social factors to inform a collaboratively developed management plan.

Risk assessment processes need to be consistent across mental health services, and staff should be trained in how to assess, formulate, and manage risk. Ongoing supervision should be available to support consistency of approach. 

Families and carers should have as much involvement as possible in the assessment process, including the opportunity to express their views on potential risk. The management plan should be collaboratively developed where possible. Communication with primary care may
also be may also be helpful.


The management of risk should be personal and individualised, but it is one part of a whole system approach that should aim to strengthen the standards of care for everyone, ensuring that supervision, delegation and referral pathways are all managed safely

Diagnosis in Psychiatry

In Medicine, by the term ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù we refer to the patient‚Äôs subjective complaints, whereas by ‚Äúsigns‚Äù we refer to those observable phenomena coming from the patient‚Äôs body. A combination of signs and symptoms, positive on a lab test for a particular illness indicates the possibility of illness. 
Unfortunately, there are no lab tests to diagnose psychiatric illnesses. The psychiatric diagnosis is description of symptoms, not an explanation of the etiology.  Medical diagnoses often point to etiology, and underlying biological causes but psychiatric diagnosis based from the etiological model is very far.  Psychiatric diagnoses are categorically different because they are merely descriptive, never explanatory or causative in nature. 

Diagnosis is a key part of how we communicate with our patients and each other. Indeed, in any situation in which more than one intervention is available some form of classification/diagnosis is needed to guide logical decisions about which intervention is better (or whether no intervention is the optimal option). Diagnosis is not only important in implementing clinical decisions but also for research and auditing purposes.  

Criticisms of psychiatric diagnostics are many such as reliability (such as how often two clinicians agree on the same diagnosis), validity (such as clear separation between diagnostic constructs or presence of objective validators) utility (such as predicting outcomes and treatment responses),  high rates of co-occurrence, and association with negative consequences such as stigma and discrimination comes with the huge tool on the population.

Mental disorders are constructs, not diseases. Descriptive, not explanatory.  Mental illnesses, affect the way you think and behave. They change your mood and can make it difficult to function at home, work, school or in your community.

The less severe the presentation, the more difficult it is to diagnose. There is no bright line demarcating the very heavily populated boundary between mental disorder and normality. 

When in doubt, it is safer and more accurate to underdiagnose.

Geriatric, Children, and teenagers are especially hard to diagnose.

Get information from all possible sources you can. No one source is ever complete. 

Consider the previous diagnoses but don‚Äôt blindly believe them

Constantly revisit the diagnosis. This is especially true when someone is not benefiting from a treatment that is based on it

Accurate diagnosis can bring great benefits; inaccurate diagnosis can bring disaster.

Suicide Risk Assessment (Suicide Prevention) Suicidal Risk Management 

Suicide can be described as a fatal act of self-harm initiated with the intention of ending one's own life. Although often seen as impulsive, it may be associated with years of suicidal behavior including suicidal ideation or acts of deliberate self-harm. 

Self-harm is defined as any act of self poisoning or self injury irrespective of motivation, and is associated with an increased risk of suicide.
Timely identification of persons at risk of suicide is critical to ensure adequate provision of care. Family physicians play an important role as most individuals who died by suicide visited their physicians in the month preceding death, and about 90% consulted their FP several times the prior year. This is a golden opportunity to train the primary care doctors and nurses in suicide screening and referral to higher centre.  

Assessing the risk of suicide in a person expressing suicidal thoughts, or presenting with self-harm or a suicide attempt, is crucial in attempting to prevent deaths. Asking questions about suicidal thoughts does not increase the risk of suicide. There are a number of risk-predicting score systems for determining suicidal intent. However, none has good predictive ability, and various psychiatric guidelines advise these should NOT be used alone. Instead a comprehensive clinical interview should be used along with the structured instruments 

Systematic suicide risk assessment should identify acute and chronic, modifiable, and treatable risk factors and weigh them against protective factors in determining management. Risk factors also have limitations. For example, a history of a prior suicide attempt is a clear risk factor for death by suicide but it is not modifiable risk factor but it dictates the management.

Warning Signs of Suicide

Wanting to die
Great guilt or shame
Being a burden to others
Empty, hopeless, trapped, or having no reason to live
Extremely sad, more anxious, agitated, or full of rage
Unbearable emotional or physical pain
Making a plan or researching ways to die
Withdrawing from friends, saying good bye, giving away important items, or making a will
Taking dangerous risks such as driving extremely fast
Displaying extreme mood swings
Eating or sleeping more or less
Using drugs or alcohol more often


Risk Factors

Previous suicide attempt
Mental illness, such as depression
Social isolation
Criminal problems
Financial problems
Impulsive or aggressive tendencies
Job problems or loss
Legal problems
Serious illness
Substance use disorder
Relationship:
Adverse childhood experiences 
Family history of suicide
Relationship problems
Sexual violence
Barriers to health care
Cultural and religious beliefs such as a belief that suicide is noble resolution of a personal problem
Suicide cluster in the community


Protective Factors:

Coping and problem-solving skills
Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide
Connections to friends, family, and community support
Supportive relationships with care providers
Availability of physical and mental health care
Limited access to lethal means among people at risk

Warning signs (sometimes called risk predictors) may be discovered by the clinician in the context of a psychiatric evaluation and often overlap with risk factors (e.g., in the case of a psychotic and intoxicated individual). The combination of both triggers suicide related behaviour

Vicarious Liability [Medical Negligence] Medical Malpractice [Liability of the hospital]

Whenever a person commits an act which is unlawful, that person is held liable for violating the law and thus he is punished accordingly, that is the general rule of torts, but in some situations a person can be made liable even if he has not done any wrong, if it is done by some other person with whom he shares a certain relation, such as master and servant or principal and agent and in these cases his liability is called vicarious liability.

Vicarious liability means the liability of a person for an act committed by another person and such liability arises due to the nature of the relation between the two 

There are many cases in which the servant does an act for his master and thus in law, it is deemed that the master was doing that act himself, therefore if the servant commits an unlawful act the master will also be held liable for the same. This liability of the master is based on the following two maxims

1.Qui facit per alium facit per se: ‚Äì It means that whenever a person gets something done by another person then the person is viewed to be doing such an act himself.

Illustration: If A is the owner of many trucks and employs drivers to drive them for the purpose of trade and in case one of his drivers gets into an accident because of his rash driving, then even though A did not drive the truck himself, he will be liable for the accident.

2. Respondant Superior: ‚Äì It means that the superior should be held responsible for the acts done by his subordinate.

These two maxims have played a significant role in the development of the law of vicarious liability of the master.

Constituents Of Vicarious Liability. 

So the constituents of vicarious liability are:

(1) There must be a relationship of a certain kind.

(2) The wrongful act must be related to the relationship in a certain way.

(3) The wrong has been done within the course of employment.

Traditional View: Test Of Control

A master is one who not only prescribes to the workmen the end of his work but directs or at any moments may direct the means also; retains the power of controlling the work.

The traditional mode of stating the distinction is that in case of servant, the employer in addition to directing what work the servant is to do, can also give directions to control the manner of doing the work; but in case of an independent contractor, the employer can only direct what work is to be done but he cannot control the manner of doing work.

Vicarious Liability deals with cases where one person is liable for the acts of others. In the field of Torts it is considered to be an exception to the general rule that a person is liable for his own acts only. It is based on the principle of qui facit per se per alium facit per se, which means, ‚ÄúHe who does an act through another is deemed in law to do it himself‚Äù. So in a case of vicarious liability both the person at whose behest the act is done as well as the person who does the act are liable. Thus, Employers are vicariously liable for the torts of their employees that are committed during the course of employment. In order that the liability of A for the act done by B can arise, it is necessary that there should be certain kind of relationship between A and B, and the wrongful act should be, in certain way, connected with that relationship. So a master is liable for the acts of his servant if the act is done in the course of employment. But where someone employs an independent contractor to do work on his behalf he is not in the ordinary way responsible for any tort committed by the contractor in the course of the execution of the work except in certain exceptional cases as dealt above.

Medical Record Documentation - Ethical and Legal Issues 

A medical record is a history of someone‚Äôs health. Most hospitals and doctor‚Äôs offices use electronic health records. Medical records are an essential piece of documentation that follows us throughout our lives. They are both a medical and legal document that comes with certain stipulations and rights that prevent the information from falling into the wrong hands or being unlawfully shared.  

What‚Äôs in a Medical Record?
A medical record includes information about a person‚Äôs: 

age, gender, and ethnicity
height and weight
medical problems (such as asthma, epilepsy, or diabetes)
mental health issues (such as anxiety or depression)
medical test results (from lab tests, X-rays, etc.)
medicines, including doses and how often the medicine is taken
allergies to medicines (both prescription and nonprescription), insect stings and bites, food, and any other substances (such as latex)
surgeries and hospitalizations
immunizations (shots)
billing and insurance


Who Can See My Child‚Äôs Medical Records?

Usually, doctors can share medical records for kids under 18 years old only if the patient‚Äôs parent or legal guardian gives permission. In some situations, though, doctors can share them without that permission (for example, if the child‚Äôs health or safety is at risk).


These records are important for future and current health professionals to better understand the patient‚Äôs health and wellness, along with any information that might improve care. However, this isn‚Äôt the only way medical records can be of service. Here are some of the top uses for medical records outside the healthcare field.

Legal cases can benefit from medical records, depending on the case. One popular example of this is personal injury law, where documentation regarding a client‚Äôs health would most certainly be necessary for a legal setting. These records cannot be accessed without a person‚Äôs consent. However, retrieving medical documents for legal solutions can be a bit of a hassle. Having the right medical document retrieval service can help expedite the process.

Insurance claims are another area where your medical records may be of service. Insurance companies often request medical documentation when evaluating claims so that any medical bills match claims that are made. In any case, they will need to have a person sign a release form to view and evaluate medical records.

Efficacy of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (effectiveness of DBT)

Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a very effective form of therapy that helps individuals learn the skills and strategies needed for a life worth living. It was originally developed as a method of treating people who were struggling with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and also who had suicidal tendencies or self-harming behaviors

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The patient populations for which DBT has the most empirical support include parasuicidal women with borderline personality disorder (BPD), but there have been promising findings for patients with BPD and substance use disorders (SUDs), persons who meet criteria for binge-eating disorder, and depressed elderly patients. Although DBT has many similarities with other cognitive-behavioral approaches, several critical and unique elements must be in place for the treatment to constitute DBT. 


DBT was initially developed to treat women diagnosed with BPD at high-risk for suicide. Other conditions that may be improved with DBT include:

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Eating disorders
Substance abuse and addictive behaviors
Self-harming behavior
Suicidal urges
Treatment resistant major depression

 DBT has been found to be helpful for treating many different conditions that involve difficulty regulating emotions, as well as unstable relationships or impulsive behaviors. 

Evidence that DBT is helpful is seen in reduced suicidal behavior, reduced hospital visits and inpatient stays, improved social functioning and in being less likely to drop out of treatment

DBT focuses on developing mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation behavioral skills as the main therapeutic tools for overcoming pervasive emotion dysregulation and suicidal ideation

Abetment of Suicide and Attempted Suicide 

Abetment is the act of inciting or compelling someone to engage in wrongdoing or unlawful activity. Abetment is a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally assisting a person in carrying out an act. If any person abets, entices, or compels someone to commit suicide, then they shall be penalised under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 for abetment of suicide.

Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, defines abetment as the act performed by:

A person abetting or inciting another person, 

A person engaging with one or more people in any conspiracy for abetting or instigating a person, 

A person intentionally aiding by any act or illegal omission for abetting or instigating a person,

A person by wilful misrepresentation concealing a material fact that he is obligated to disclose or attempts to cause or procure voluntarily comes within the act of instigation.

 A person abetting, enticing or compelling someone to commit an offence is known as an ‚Äúabettor‚Äù as per Section 108 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Abetment of suicide is referred to as the mental process of instigating, encouraging, or assisting someone in committing suicide. A conviction cannot stand without an intentional effort on the part of the accused to encourage or abet suicide. 

Ingredients of abetment of suicide or attempted suicide 

- Mens rea (intent of the abettor)
- Physical proximity with abettor 
- Physical act / willful act to push the victim to commit suicide / any positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide
- Temporal association with time 
- Victim did not had anyway out (no alternative solutions were not available)
- It should not be related to any other administrative issues 
- Accused cannot be held guilty of abetment of suicide if the deceased appeared to be of weak character and unable to handle the ups and downs of life.

Abetment of suicide is an act of abetting, instigating, or aiding the victim in committing suicide. It is concluded that abetment is one of the most serious and heinous crimes.

Theoretical aspects of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) originally developed to treat women with a history of chronic suicidal behavior who meet the criteria for borderline
personality disorder (M Linehan, 1993). According to Marsha Linehan, Standard DBT includes multiple modes of treatment, including weekly individual therapy, weekly group skills training, and as-needed phone coaching to address skill and motivational problems common in people diagnosed with BPD. 


The original manualized DBT program consists of four group skills training modules 

a) Group skill training of mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance modules, 

b) individual counseling, 

c) telephone crisis coaching, and 

d) a therapist consultation team

The DBT components became popular because it address skills deficits (via group skills training modules and phone coaching), in addition to issues related to motivation for change through individual therapy.

Typically, DBT skills training aims to teach skills to reduce dysfunctional behavior and facilitate the adoption of new behavioral, emotional, and thinking patterns through (but not exclusively delivered in) a group format(Linehan, 1993). 

Four modules address skills deficits associated with BPD: 

(a) core mindfulness skills center on ways to strategically deploy attentional control;

(b) emotion regulation skills teach clients to identify and influence emotions elicited by the
environment; 

(c) interpersonal effectiveness skills help clients to learn to respond effectively to
interpersonal demands and conflicts; and 

(d) distress tolerance skills teach clients to identify crisis situations and experience strong negative emotions while inhibiting dysfunctional behaviors that could serve to make the situation worse (Linehan, 1993)

Currently, DBT group skills training standalone modules are being utilized in some capacity in a wide variety of clinical settings that serve a diversity of client populations (e.g., Dimeff & Koerner, 2007). Considering the high cost and professional investment required to administer a DBT group
(e.g., two group leaders, weekly 2.5 hour sessions, expensive, individual therapy, telephone support and time-consuming group leader training and supervision), it is important that future studies compare DBT skills group treatment standalone to other forms of therapy to determine whether DBT skills training is actually more effective than shorter term and less expensive treatments.

The general lack of randomization, control groups, and longer-term follow-up in many of
these DBT group skills training standalone modules studies is to be expected, given the early stage of this literature. These studies represent the creative application of DBT skills training as a means of improving global functioning by reducing dysfunctional behaviors. 

Although one need to be cautious to interpret outcome data from uncontrolled studies, we can use
these findings to inform future treatment research. There is some preliminary evidence of the
feasibility and acceptability of standalone DBT skills training across a range of populations (i.e., incarcerated adults and adolescents, adults with intellectual disability, and caregivers at risk for elder abuse perpetration)

Medical Certificate - Ethical and Legal Issues 

Medical Certificate is a statement from a physician or other health care provider that attests to the result of a medical examination of a patient.
This is a document issued after a medical examination, which usually constitutes acceptable evidence in the court of law.  Medical Certificate is a legal document and it can be challenged in the court of law. 

Medico-Legal experts recommends the following guidelines regarding issuing of the medical certificate:

1. Never give it for more than 15 days. 
2. See the Patient again after 15 days and reissue. 
3. Even in repeat cases, make sure that he or she is the patient, identify the pt. By photo I. D. Card, and then issue. *Not to the attendants.* 
3. Avoid issuing a certificate for diseases that you are not treating / or trained to treat. (Other Disciplines)
4. Describe the disability at best as you can even if you don‚Äôt know how to grade it. 
5. MOST IMPORTANT*It is a legal document*
Even if you print otherwise, it is admissible in court & you can‚Äôt say, ‚Äù that it was not intended for legal purposes‚Äù
6. The certificate must address a particular person‚Ä¶.‚Äù like Principal of the school, employer, etc.  Don‚Äôt write whomsoever it may concern.*
7. Never give from backdating.
8. Never give without your OPD days.
9. Never give fitness on an advanced date or backdate.
10. Never give fitness, if Rest gave by somebody else.
11. Give if you can justify the disease or ailment and duration also for that particular disease.
12. If there is no disease, then always ask purpose why are you want to take medication, then only give 2- 3 days If someone‚Äôs family member in severe life-threatening to attending him on humanity ground, pl verify it before giving, because opinion can differ person to person.
13.  The physical presence of the patient is a must. May be at abroad or heavenly abode. So never write down PNB (Patient NOT Brought) 
14. You are responsible for class one gazetted officer verifying the physical presence and attendance.
Legally and valid document in court to justify the presence and absence of accused and deceased at the scene of the crime.

As per the MCI regulations of 2002 -

1.3.3 A Registered medical practitioner shall maintain a Register of Medical Certificates giving full details of certificates issued. When issuing a medical certificate he / she shall always enter the identification marks of the patient and keep a copy of the certificate. He / She shall not omit
to record the signature and/or thumb mark, address and at least one identification mark of the patient on the medical certificates or report.

7.7 Signing Professional Certificates, Reports and other Documents: Registered medical practitioners are in certain cases bound by law to give, or may from time to time be called upon or requested to give certificates, notification, reports and other documents of similar character signed by them in their professional capacity for subsequent use in the courts or for

Assumptions in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) originally developed to treat women with a history of chronic suicidal behavior who meet criteria for borderline
personality disorder (M Linehan, 1993). According to Marsha Linehan, Standard DBT includes multiple modes of treatment, including weekly individual therapy, weekly group skills training, and as-needed phone coaching to address skill and motivational problems common in people diagnosed with BPD. 


The original manualized DBT program consists of four group skills training modules

Every therapy operates with a certain set of basic assumptions. These are sets of hypotheses‚Äô, facts or statements that are taken for granted. They are not always articulated, but they are acted upon as rules and guidelines for treatment.

DBT is no different. It too operates with a certain set of assumptions. In DBT, however, the assumptions are clearly articulated.

About Clients

- People are doing the best that they can.
- People want to improve
- People must learn new behaviors both in therapy and in the context of their day-to-day life.
- People cannot fail in DBT
- People may not have caused all of their problems, but they have to solve them anyway.
- People need to do better, try harder and be more motivated to change.
- The lives of people who are suicidal are unbearable as they are currently being lived.


About Treatment

- The most caring thing a therapist or treatment provider can do is help people change in ways that bring them closer to their own ultimate goals.
- Clarity, precision and compassion are of the utmost importance.
- The treatment relationship is a real relationship between equals.
- Principles of behavior are universal, affecting clinicians no less than clients.
- Treatment providers need support
- Treatment providers can fail.

Somatization Disorder [Bodily Distress Disorder] Briquet‚Äôs syndrome [Somatoform Disorders] Hysteria [medically unexplained syndrome]  somatic symptom and related disorders

Somatic symptom disorder  also called as somatization disorder 

Somatization Disorder means in which the physical pain and symptoms a person feels are related to psychological factors. These symptoms can‚Äôt be traced to a specific physical cause. In people who have a somatic symptom and related disorders, medical test results are either normal or don‚Äôt explain the person‚Äôs symptoms.

Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be:

- Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness

- Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected

- A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms
Mild, moderate or severe

- Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling.

 Patients report of thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include:

Constant worry about potential illness

Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness

Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence

Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful

Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate

Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body

Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities

Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse

Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects

Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition


The exact cause of somatic symptom disorder isn't clear, but any of these factors may play a role:

Genetic and biological factors, such as an increased sensitivity to pain

Family influence, which may be genetic or environmental, or both

Personality trait of negativity, which can impact how you identify and perceive illness and bodily symptoms

Decreased awareness of or problems processing emotions, causing physical symptoms to become the focus rather than the emotional issues

Learned behavior ‚Äî for example, the attention or other benefits gained from having an illness; or "pain behaviors" in response to symptoms, such as excessive avoidance of activity, which can increase your level of disability

Treatment 

People who have this disorder may have several medical evaluations and tests to be sure that they don‚Äôt have another illness. They often become very worried about their health because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing their health problems. Their symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other illnesses and may last for several years. People who have a somatoform disorder are not faking their symptoms. The pain that they feel is real

Treatment seeks to enhance a person‚Äôs daily functioning by reducing stress, mitigating physical symptoms and improving overall functioning. Somatoform disorder treatment options include various forms of psychotherapy and pharmacological interventions when co-occurring conditions like depression or anxiety are present.

Pharmacological Interventions
Pharmacological interventions alone are not effective in treating. However, medication for a somatoform disorder may be helpful if concurrent depression or anxiety disorders are present. Pharmacological interventions are most helpful when paired with therapy.

Several types of antidepressants are generally prescribed to people with somatoform disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions that can exacerbate symptoms. Antidepressant medications work indirectly on somatoform disorder by easing symptoms of anxiety and depression that can increase concern and worry about physical symptoms.


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)  has been shown to effective in some cases, though additional research is needed to confirm these claims. CBT helps individuals reduce fixation on their health, pain and physical symptoms. This treatment method also teaches stress reduction techniques and coping skills to manage physical symptoms and emotional reactions

Problem Solving and Decision Making

Problem solving is a valuable skill that can really only be learnt, and perfected, through continual practice. A wide range of problem solving models and techniques are available to assist in evaluating and solving diverse problems of varying degrees of complexity.

Problem-solving skills help you determine the source of a problem and find an effective solution. Although problem-solving is often identified as its own separate skill, there are other related skills that contribute to this ability.

Effective problem solving strategies.

1.Define and understand the problem
2.Assess the scale of the problem
3.Gather relevant information
4.Identify the root causes
5.Test the hypothesis
6.Involve others
7.Consider the proposed solution(s)
8.Test the proposed solution
9.Champion your decision
10.Monitor the results


Problem solving and decision making are not synonymous with each other, but they are both important skills for everyone to have. People often use the terms problem solving and decision making interchangeably specifically because they have elements in common.

Problem solving and decision making involve critical thinking.

Critical thinking is a process by which you question your own assumptions ‚Äì as well as those of others - in order to decide on next steps to solve a problem. Critical thinking often results in using a mix of research, analysis, questioning and exploration of new ideas in order to gain rich insight into a situation, becoming informed in a way that isn‚Äôt restricted by the subjective perspectives of peers or the status quo.

Problem-Solving: A Step by Step Approach
1. Identify the problem?

There is no better starting point than defining what it is that needs to be fixed.

It means taking the time to thoroughly review the situation - separating the symptoms from the cause. Making your diagnosis is about understanding what hurts and why. This takes time and might mean doing a bit of research to reveal the underlying issues behind the problem.

2. Determine the Root Causes

Once you have identified what your problem is, you need to figure out why it is.

What is behind it?
What is causing it?
Can it be quantified or qualified.
What is going on at a core level?
Because as you work towards solving your problem, you are going to want to find a solution that deals with the causes and not just the symptoms, right?  So again, take the time to investigate the situation. Collect information, analyze your findings, and refine your diagnosis.

3. Find Multiple Solutions

Being a good problem-solver means thinking innovatively and that means thinking outside the box. Do not settle for the first solution you find. Push the boat out. Find as many alternative solutions as you can. And then find some more.

This might mean looking for solutions in unusual places or from unusual sources ‚Äì talking to a different set of colleagues, keeping an open mind, or being receptive to the interchange of ideas or perspectives. Whatever if it takes, once you have a set of alternative solutions, subject them all to analysis.

4. Find the Solution that will Work Best

Easier said than done? Not necessarily. Go about it logically. Answer these questions:

Is it technically viable?
Is it scale-able?
Do you have the resources?
What are the risks? Can they be managed?
Does your solution benefit as many people as possible?
Can it be measured? How will you measure it?
5. Plan and Implement Your Solution

Give this part plenty of thought too. Build a really tight plan to execute your solution.  You will need to cover who, what, when, and how you will implement your plan.

And just as importantly, you will need to think about how you are going to determine if your solution was a success, which leads us to the final step.

6. Measure the Success of Your Solution

How does it measure against your goals? Have you met your objectives? Have you stayed within budget? Is the work complete? Can you see a measurable outcome? 

Evaluating the success of your solution is a vital ‚Äì and often neglected step ‚Äì because it shows you clearly whether your solution is the correct one, or whether you need to go back to step one and start over. Because a key part of problem-solving effectively is about being prepared to get it wrong ‚Äì and to learn from your mistakes.

Comparing Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Vs Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) [CBT vs DBT]

Not all mental illnesses respond to treatment in the same way. A therapy technique that works well for depression and anxiety can exacerbate eating disorders or personality disorders.

CBT has been shown to be incredibly effective when treating depression, and is more likely to make depression go into remission than other types of therapy. This method of therapy has also been proven beneficial in treating anxiety, as it gives patients control over their recovery. CBT has also been shown to help with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and sleeping issues.

DBT was created to help those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. DBT focuses on helping people change their behavior patterns, as opposed to trying to think or talk through the issues they are struggling with. This type of CBT helps those who have developed patterns of intense emotional reactions and impulsive behaviors in response to what patients describe as overwhelming feelings of pain and rejection ‚Äì the feeling of walking through a world filled with knives. DBT often is the most effective therapy for those who struggle with self-harm behaviors like cutting and chronic suicidal ideation. Sexual trauma survivors also respond well to DBT techniques


CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts and behaviors influence our feelings, so changing the way we think about and react to situations will help us feel better. However, standard CBT isn‚Äôt effective in treating all mental illnesses. Another common type of therapy is called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a more specific form of CBT that focuses on helping people who tend to have extreme emotional reactions interact with the environment around them in a less emotional, healthier way. 

CBT focuses on how your thoughts, feelings and behavior influence each other. While DBT does work on these things, emphasis is given more towards regulating emotions, being mindful, and learning to accept pain. CBT seeks to give patients the ability to recognize when their thoughts might become troublesome, and gives them techniques to redirect those thoughts. DBT helps patients find ways to accept themselves, feel safe, and manage their emotions to help regulate potentially destructive or harmful behaviors.

Clients who engage in DBT therapy participate in DBT skills training sessions that are typically taught in a group setting in four modules. Most patients also meet weekly with a DBT therapist or DBT coach and receive DBT phone coaching as needed when they need help the most. Sometimes, once patients are able to use DBT skills to regulate their emotions, practice mindfulness, and improve relationships with others, they are able to transition to more standard CBT groups to address specific negative thought patterns or recurring harmful behaviors.

Critical Thinking - An essential Life Skill  


Critical thinking is the ability to make informed decisions by evaluating several different sources of information objectively. 

Critical thinking is the ability to think in an organized and rational manner in order to understand connections between ideas and/or facts. 


Someone with critical thinking skills is able to think rationally and clearly about what they should or not believe. They are capable of engaging in their own thoughts, and doing some reflection in order to come to a well-informed conclusion. Critical thinkers rigorously question ideas and assumptions rather than accepting them at face value
 

A critical thinker understands the connections between ideas, and is able to construct arguments based on facts, as well as find mistakes in reasoning.It helps you decide what to believe in. In other words, it‚Äôs ‚Äúthinking about thinking‚Äù‚Äîidentifying, analyzing, and then fixing flaws in the way we think


The term critical comes from the Greek word kritikos meaning discerning. So critical thinking is a deeper kind of thinking in which we do not take things for granted but question, analyse and evaluate what we read, hear, say, or write. It is a general term used to identify essential mindsets and skills that contribute to effective decision making. While there are many definitions for critical thinking, here is one that covers its essential aspects:

Critical thinking seeks to identify reliable information and make reliable judgements. It encompasses mindset and skills, both of which can be developed through an understanding of key concepts, practice and application.




what critical thinkers do ‚Äì the skills they display. You might say that a critical thinker:

-questions everything, including existing social norms and traditions
-thinks systematically, considering all aspects of a problem and looking at each element in its wider context
-carefully examines ideas and information
-looks beyond what may appear as obvious
-uses evidence to support claims
-uses logic and reason in their arguments
-avoids making assumptions
-can recognise (and avoid) logical fallacies
-strives to be aware of their own cognitive biases
-considers different perspectives
-uses the above critical thinking skills to make judgements.


How To Improve Your Critical Thinking

Define Your Question: When it comes to critical thinking, it‚Äôs important to always keep your goal in mind. Know what you‚Äôre trying to achieve, and then figure out how to best get there.

Gather Reliable Information: Make sure that you‚Äôre using sources you can trust ‚Äî biases aside. That‚Äôs how a real critical thinker operates!

Ask The Right Questions: We all know the importance of questions, but be sure that you‚Äôre asking the right questions that are going to get you to your answer.

Look Short & Long Term: When coming up with solutions, think about both the short- and long-term consequences. Both of them are significant in the equation.

Explore All Sides: There is never just one simple answer, and nothing is black or white. Explore all options and think outside of the box before you come to any conclusions.


Skills You Need note that someone with critical thinking skills can:

- understand links between ideas
- determine the importance and relevance of arguments and ideas
- recognise, build and appraise arguments
- identify inconsistencies and errors in reasoning
- approach problems consistently and systematically
- reflect on the justification of their own assumptions, beliefs and values.

Creative vs critical thinking 

Creative thinking involves searching for meaningful new connections by generating many unusual, original, and varied possibilities, as well as details that expand or enrich possibilities. 

Critical thinking, on the other hand, involves examining possibilities carefully, fairly, and constructively focusing your thoughts and actions by organizing and analyzing possibilities, refining and developing the most promising possibilities, ranking or prioritizing options, and choosing certain options.

To conclude - Critical thinking is analyzing and developing possibilities to: compare and contrast many ideas; improve and refine ideas; make effective decisions and judgments; and provide a sound foundation for effective action

National Suicide Prevention Strategy (NSPS 2022) of India

India National Suicide Prevention Strategy: The government has recently unveiled a national-level suicide prevention plan, the first of its kind. Here are its key features

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Monday (November 21) unveiled the National Suicide Prevention Strategy. The goal of the strategy is to reduce suicide mortality in the country by 10 per cent by 2023. The strategy provides a framework for multiple stakeholders to implement activities for the prevention of suicides in the country.

First, it seeks to establish effective surveillance mechanisms for suicide within the next three years.

Second, it seeks to establish psychiatric outpatient departments that will provide suicide prevention services through the District Mental Health Programme in all districts within the next five years.

Third, it aims to integrate a mental well-being curriculum in all educational institutions within the next eight years.

The fourth objective of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy is to strengthen surveillance of suicide and further generation of evidence through evaluation, that will ensure improvement in the programme quality.

Pathways to achieve these objectives as follows 

- Reinforcing leadership, partnerships and institutional capacity in the country
‚Äì Enhancing the capacity of health services to provide suicide prevention services
‚Äì Developing community resilience and societal support for suicide prevention and reduce stigma associated with suicidal behaviours
- Strengthen surveillance of suicide 

The implementation framework of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy envisions five key stakeholders responsible for realising the objectives. These include national-level ministerial stakeholders, state-level governmental stakeholders, district-level governmental stakeholders, NIMHANS-Bangalore and other top mental health institutes, and strategic collaborators.

The strategy broadly seeks to establish effective surveillance mechanisms for suicide within the next three years, establish psychiatric outpatient departments that will provide suicide prevention services through the District Mental Health Programme in all districts within the next five years, and to integrate a mental well-being curriculum in all educational institutions within the next eight years. It envisages developing guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicides, and restricting access to means of suicide.

Primary care psychiatry (Psychiatry for Doctors) Mental health awareness for doctors

According to the National Mental Health Survey, 2016, the current prevalence of psychiatric disorders in India is 10.6%. Common mental disorders (CMDs) form the significant bulk with a prevalence of around 10%, whereas severe mental disorders have a prevalence of 0.8%. The treatment gap for most of the psychiatric disorders is around 80%'

There is now almost universal recognition that primary care is the place where most mentally distressed people first present for help. However, the pace at which the health system has adapted to this reality varies greatly from country to country, depending on the amount of resource devoted to mental illness services, the way in which primary care physicians have organized their practice, and the inertia of the system

 Around 70% of the Indian population reside in rural areas, whereas the distribution of doctors/mental health professionals follows an opposite trend, with a concentration of specialists in urban areas. This hampers the delivery of services to the majority of the Indian population. Primary care doctors (PCDs) are most often the first contact for these patients. Several studies have been conducted to study the prevalence of CMDs in patient population consulting PCDs and have shown that 17%‚Äì46% of this population need psychiatric care. However, majority of PCDs are ill equipped to handle the psychiatric disorders and provide symptomatic treatment which further lead to chronicity of illnesses in the population.


Integrating psychiatric care into primary health care appears to be a viable option to manage the above-mentioned roadblocks. Dysfunctional work patterns of PCDs are the reason for ‚Äúfunctional treatment gap‚Äù at primary care to provide psychiatric treatment but provide symptomatic treatment to them Integrating psychiatric care into primary health care appears to be a viable option to manage the above-mentioned roadblocks.

There is now almost universal recognition that primary care is the place where most mentally distressed people first present for help, and also an acceptance that, even in physical disorders, the proper psychological management of distress is an important component of treatment. Most medical schools throughout the world do not provide enough instruction to future physicians in the management of common mental disorders, preferring to emphasise the much rarer major mental disorders. Those entering general medical practice therefore have an unmet need for supplementary training, and the speed at which the Virtual Group acquired enthusiastic members is testament to this need.

As has been emphasised, the training need goes well beyond the ranks of physicians, and extends to community nurses and social workers in developed countries, and to MPHWs and health workers of various sorts in developing countries.

Practical tips for Telephone Counsellor (Tele-counselling Tips)

21 Practical Tips for Telephone Counsellor

Telephone counselling/therapy is a structured therapeutic relationship, where the client and therapist speak on the telephone, rather than meeting in person. When clients arrange their telephone sessions, they are provided with a designated telephone number, which they call at the prearranged time, when their therapist will be available to speak to them. Sessions, like face-to-face ones, are with the same therapist, and usually take place at the same time, and on the same day, each week. The flexibility of telephone counselling/therapy provides access to therapy for clients for whom there are significant barriers to attending in person, or because of crisis, or stigma and many more reasons 

Counselling skills are interpersonal and technical traits that a counsellor uses to better understand and listen to their clients. Using these skills, a counsellor helps a client overcome obstacles that are preventing them from leading a happy life. These skills help you build rapport, establish trust and ensure that your clients feel heard and understood.

Telephone Counselling Tips

- Do not eat, drink or chew gum while speaking to a caller on the phone.

- Speak clearly and project a positive attitude.

- Have necessary resources available (message pad, telephone list, and pen).

- Identify yourself when answering (‚ÄúGood morning, Department Name, this is Jane Doe.‚Äù)

- Do not converse with others while on a call. If necessary, place the caller on hold (press the hold button and do not lay the phone on the desk).

- Always ask permission to place someone on hold.

- Never leave the caller on hold for too long, without checking back with them and thanking them for their patience.

- When transferring a call, give the caller the extension number you are transferring them to, in case the call is lost.

-When ending a phone call, always say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù

Theoretical aspects of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) originally developed to treat persons with a history of chronic suicidal behavior who meet criteria for borderline
personality disorder (M Linehan, 1993). According to Marsha Linehan, Standard DBT includes multiple modes of treatment, including weekly individual therapy, weekly group skills training, and as-needed phone coaching to address skill and motivational problems common in people diagnosed with BPD. Further, meeting of the DBT therapists is mandatory to stay on track for providing care. In this video, I will be discussing theory of DBT. 


The original manualized DBT program consists of four group skills training modules 

a) Group skill training of mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance modules, 

b) individual counseling, 

c) telephone crisis coaching, and 

d) a therapist consultation team

The DBT components became popular because it address skills deficits (via group skills training modules and phone coaching), in addition to issues related to motivation for change through individual therapy.

Typically, DBT skills training aims to teach skills to reduce dysfunctional behavior and facilitate the adoption of new behavioral, emotional, and thinking patterns through (but not exclusively delivered in) a group format(Linehan, 1993). 

Four modules address skills deficits associated with BPD: 

(a) core mindfulness skills center on ways to strategically deploy attentional control;

(b) emotion regulation skills teach clients to identify and influence emotions elicited by the
environment; 

(c) interpersonal effectiveness skills help clients to learn to respond effectively to
interpersonal demands and conflicts; and 

(d) distress tolerance skills teach clients to identify crisis situations and experience strong negative emotions while inhibiting dysfunctional behaviors that could serve to make the situation worse (Linehan, 1993)

Caregiving to our Aged Parents (Caregivers Stress)

Who are caregivers? Caregivers provide care to people who need some degree of ongoing assistance with everyday tasks on a regular or daily basis. The recipients of care can live either in residential or institutional settings, range from children to older adults, and have chronic illnesses or disabling conditions.

The ‚Äúinformal or unpaid care‚Äù because it is provided by family or friends rather than by paid caregivers. The one year value of this unpaid caregiver activity was estimated as $450 billion dollars in 2009.

What is the impact of providing care for an older adult?

Informal or unpaid caregiving has been associated with:

Elevated levels of depression and anxiety
Higher use of psychoactive medications
Worse self-reported physical health
Compromised immune function
Increased risk of early death

Over half (53%) of caregivers indicate that a decline in their health compromises their ability to provide care. There is tremendous pressure on families to take on the care of disabled. As the need for care keeps on increasing, the human resources seem to be dwindling. 

The provision of informal care over prolonged periods of time can have profound consequences for the caregiver. The responsibilities of caring often constrain social participation and necessitate withdrawal from the work force. Intensive caring can have adverse effects on the psychological health of carers. There is consistent evidence that carers are more at risk of mental health problems, particularly stress and depression, than other adults of the same age. For example, providing care for individuals with dementia has profound consequences for family caregivers

Information and education has a central role in caregiver interventions and shall form the basic ingredient of caregiver interventions. The caregiver and the care recipient should have easy access to information regarding the health condition and its management. This information should include practical management tips, especially about difficult symptoms. Caregivers should also be made aware of issues related to informal care and about their own health. Opportunities for discussion and guidance from health care providers will help. Providing emotional and social support to the care recipient and the caregivers is another essential ingredient of caregiver interventions. It is always important to offer long-term care and support instead of a onetime intervention. Caregivers should also know where to get help when home-based care faces a crisis.

Reaching families engaged in home-based care is crucial. Community outreach services will have to play a major role in identifying and supporting families engaged in home-based care. The primary caregiver in each of these families has to be identified and their care needs should be assessed. Designing and delivering interventions will be next logical step. These interventions need to be culturally acceptable.

Simple inexpensive caregiver interventions which can be delivered by the outreach services will have the potential for scaling up. We need to seriously consider generic interventions which would be helpful for all family caregivers irrespective of the diagnosis of the care recipient. Health workers with brief training could then be able to deliver these community based interventions to strengthen home-based care and ameliorate caregiver burden.

There is a need to share the caregiving responsibility among individuals, families, and the government. We cannot leave the responsibility of home-based care to the families and hope that the traditional family network is capable of absorbing any amount of stress. The burden of care is real and can have adverse impact. It is only fair and prudent for the governments and the society at large, to step in and support the efforts of these families. Support to caregivers and efforts to foster their well-being are crucial for sustaining long term care. A public health frame work will help in strengthening informal care.

More caregivers will be needed. As the number of older Indian increases, so will the number of caregivers needed to provide care. The number of people 65 years old and older is expected to increase many folds by 2050. 

The health of caregivers is at risk.

Informal or unpaid caregivers (family members or friends) are the backbone of long-term care provided in people‚Äôs homes. While some aspects of caregiving may be rewarding, caregivers can also be at increased risk for negative health consequences. These may include stress, depression, difficulty maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and staying up to date on recommended clinical preventive services.

Assuming a public health frame work would result in exploration of population based information on various aspects of caregiving. We need to know the number of caregivers in the population and their characteristics.

Self-awareness - Life Skills  (Introspection) Reflection skills

"Self-awareness is the ability to focus on yourself and how your actions, thoughts, or emotions do or don't align with your internal standards

Research suggests that when we see ourselves clearly, we are more confident and more creative. We make sounder decisions, build stronger relationships, and communicate more effectively. We‚Äôre less likely to lie, cheat, and steal. We are better workers who get more promotions.

Across the studies, two broad categories of self-awareness kept emerging. The first, 'internal self-awareness', represents how clearly we see our own values, passions, aspirations, fit with our environment, reactions (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, strengths, and weaknesses), and impact on others. Internal self-awareness is associated with higher job and relationship satisfaction, personal and social control, and happiness; it is negatively related to anxiety, stress, and depression.

The second category, external self-awareness, means understanding how other people view us, in terms of those same factors listed above. Research shows that people who know how others see them are more skilled at showing empathy and taking others‚Äô perspectives. For leaders who see themselves as their employees do, their employees tend to have a better relationship with them, feel more satisfied with them, and see them as more effective in general.

Leaders who focus on building both internal and external self-awareness, who seek honest feedback from loving critics, and who ask what instead of why can learn to see themselves more clearly ‚Äî and reap the many rewards that increased self-knowledge delivers. And no matter how much progress we make, there‚Äôs always more to learn. That‚Äôs one of the things that makes the journey to self-awareness so exciting.

Addictive Behaviors [Gaming Disorder] Gambling Disorder 

Gambling disorder

Gambling disorder involves repeated, problem gambling behavior. The behavior leads to problems for the individual, families, and society. Adults and adolescents with gambling disorder have trouble controlling their gambling. They will continue even when it causes significant problems.

A diagnosis of gambling disorder requires at least four of the following during the past year:

- Need to gamble with increasing amounts to achieve the desired excitement.

- Restless or irritable when trying to cut down or stop gambling.

- Repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back on or stop gambling.

- Frequent thoughts about gambling (such as reliving past gambling or planning future gambling).

- Often gambling when feeling distressed.

- After losing money gambling, often returning to get even. (This is referred to as "chasing" one's losses.)

- Lying to hide gambling activity.

- Risking or losing a close relationship, a job, or a school or job opportunity because of gambling.

- Relying on others to help with money problems caused by gambling



Gaming Disorder 

Gaming disorder is defined as a pattern of gaming behavior (‚Äúdigital-gaming‚Äù or ‚Äúvideo-gaming‚Äù) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences. 

Studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital- or video-gaming activities. However, people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities, particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour.

For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be severe enough that it results in significant impairment to a person's functioning in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas, and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months.

The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 follows the development of treatment programmes for people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world, and will result in the increased attention of health professionals to the risks of development of this disorder and, accordingly, to relevant prevention and treatment measures.

Treatment of Gambling & Gaming Disorder

Gambling & Gaming affects people in different ways. Different approaches may work better for different people. Several types of therapy are used to treat gambling disorders, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, group therapy, and family therapy.

Counseling can help people understand gambling and think about how gambling affects them and their family. It can also help people consider options and solve problems.

There are no FDA-approved medications to treat gambling disorders. Some medications may help treat co-occurring conditions like depression or anxiety.

Support from family and friends can be critical to a person's recovery from gambling. However, only the individual can decide to stop the behaviors.

Counseling can help in following:

Gain control over your gambling & gaming.
Heal family relationships.
Deal with your urge to gamble & gaming.
Handle stress and other problems.
Find other things to do with your time.
Put your finances in order.
Maintain recovery and avoid triggers. 
Support groups, such as Gamblers Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, use peer support to help others 


Reach out for support. Call a trusted friend or family member. 

Distract yourself with other activities.
Postpone gambling & gaming  

Giving yourself time may allow the urge to pass or weaken.

Stop for a moment and consider what will happen when you 
gamble.

Avoid isolation.

Problem gamblers and gamers are at increased risk of suicide. It‚Äôs very important to take any thoughts or talk of suicide seriously.

Interpersonal Skills - Life Skills  

Interpersonal skills are the behaviors and tactics a person uses to interact with others effectively. In the business world, the term refers to an employee's ability to work well with others. Interpersonal skills range from communication and listening to attitude and deportment.

Interpersonal skills are the skills we use every day when we communicate and interact with other people, both individually and in groups. They include a wide range of skills, but particularly communication skills such as listening and effective speaking. They also include the ability to control and manage your emotions. It is no exaggeration to say that interpersonal skills are the foundation for success in life. People with strong interpersonal skills tend to be able to work well with other people, including in teams or groups, formally and informally. They communicate effectively with others, whether family, friends, colleagues, customers or clients. They also have better relationships at home and at work.

You can improve your interpersonal skills by developing your awareness of how you interact with others and practising your skills.

The skills you need and use to communicate and interact with other people. Those skills are as follows 

1. Verbal Communication ‚Äì what we say and how we say it;

2. Non-Verbal Communication ‚Äì what we communicate without words, for example through body language, or tone of voice; and

3. Listening Skills ‚Äì how we interpret both the verbal and non-verbal messages sent by others.

4. Emotional intelligence ‚Äì being able to understand and manage your own and others‚Äô emotions.

5. Team-working ‚Äì being able to work with others in groups and teams, both formal and informal.

6. Negotiation, persuasion and influencing skills ‚Äì working with others to find a mutually agreeable (Win/Win) outcome. This may be considered a subset of communication, but it is often treated separately.

7. Conflict resolution and mediation ‚Äì working with others to resolve interpersonal conflict and disagreements in a positive way, which again may be considered a subset of communication.

8. Problem solving and decision-making ‚Äì working with others to identify, define and solve problems, which includes making decisions about the best course of action

Most people have the potential to exhibit good soft skills, only this aspect of their personality has been eclipsed by negative behaviour that they have learnt over time.

The first step to improving your interpersonal skills is to honestly ask yourself whether you have a blind spot when it comes to people skills, identify target behaviours that are holding back the people-person in you, and then decide to do something about it.

If you‚Äôre ready to take the leap, there are many tools to help you, including online courses, personality development courses that teach life skills, and a more exclusive method

Effective Communication Skills - An important Life Skill

Communication skills are the abilities you use when giving and receiving different kinds of information. Communication skills involve listening, speaking, observing and empathizing. It is also helpful to understand the differences in how to communicate through face-to-face interactions, phone conversations and digital communications like email and social media.

When considering the definition of communication skills, it's important to remember that communication occurs in many different ways and contexts. From writing and speaking to body language, we use various skills to convey and obtain information. However, demonstrating strong communication skills is about being able to convey information to others in a simple and unambiguous way.

It involves the distribution of messages clearly and concisely, in a way that connects with the audience.

Good communication is about understanding instructions, acquiring new skills, making requests, asking questions and relaying information with ease.

Good communication skills are perhaps the most basic skills that you can possess as an employee, yet they remain one of the most sought-after by employers.

Good communication involves understanding requests, asking questions and relaying key information.

Developing better communication habits requires several important skills that work in tandem with each other. Some of these skills involve the way you speak or hold your body, and others are more emotionally based interpersonal skills. Here are a few skills that good communicators possess:

- Listening skills: Clear communication starts with active listening. If you‚Äôre just focused on how you are expressing yourself, chances are you are not listening or reacting to what others are bringing to the table. An effective communicator uses a variety of listening styles. They pay close attention to what‚Äôs being said and make others feel heard and considered.

- Empathy: Being able to understand the feelings of those around you is an integral part of being an effective communicator. Empathizing means both understanding and relating to someone else‚Äôs feelings. Having high emotional intelligence and demonstrating an ability to empathize builds rapport between you and others and increases your ability to communicate.

- Nonverbal communication skills: In addition to verbal messages, effective communication relies on nonverbal cues. Developing an awareness of your body language and tone of voice will improve your messaging and presentation skills.

Prescription Errors [Medication Errors] Electronic Prescription 

Prescription errors may lead to adverse events which may be largely preventable. A clinically meaningful prescribing error occurs when, as a result of a prescribing decision or prescription writing process, there is an unintentional significant

(1) reduction in probability of treatment being timely and effective or 

(2) increase in the risk of harm when compared with generally accepted practice

On the other hand, A medication error is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient. Mistakes in the prescribing, dispensing, storing, preparation and administration of a medicine are the most common preventable cause of undesired adverse events in medication practice and present a major public health burden.

Electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) is an important part of the nation's push to enhance the safety and quality of the prescribing process. E-prescribing allows providers in the ambulatory care setting to send prescriptions electronically to the pharmacy and can be a stand-alone system or part of an integrated electronic health record system. 

E-prescribing also helps to make patient care more efficient. It streamlines the process of getting the prescription to the pharmacy, dispensing the medication, and obtaining refills. Because the patient is not given a hard copy of the prescription, the potential for losing the prescription is eliminated. The instances of pharmacy-initiated clarifications have decreased, reducing the amount of time pharmacists and providers spend on the phone and thus reducing the time taken to fill the prescription and get it to the patient. Increased compliance and monitoring of compliance are also results of implementing e-prescribing. 

Although it is difficult to quantify precisely the extent of prescription errors, they are frequent and often avoidable representing a major threat to patient safety. While in India prescription errors rates reported in a range between 3% to 45%, which depend largely on defintion of error, study place, IP vs OP basis & types of study methods used.

Since prescribing is one of the common tasks in daily general practice, there seems abundant evidence of continuous poor prescribing worldwide. Prescription errors account for 70% of medication errors that could potentially result in adverse effects

Empathy - A Life Skill

Empathy is, at its simplest, awareness of the feelings and emotions of other people. It is a key element of Emotional Intelligence, the link between self and others, because it is how we as individuals understand what others are experiencing as if we were feeling it ourselves.

Empathy may be defined as an accurate understanding of the perspective or the experience of someone else. To be empathic would mean, to some extent, seeing another‚Äôs perspective (both intellectual and emotional) and having some understanding of the legitimacy of that perspective. It is important to note that, in most cases, an intellectual understanding is insufficient ‚Äì to be empathic one must understand the emotional experience of that individual. Understanding other people's emotions is a key skill in the workplace. It can enable us to resolve conflicts, to build more productive teams, and to improve our relationships with co-workers, clients and customers

Empathy goes far beyond sympathy, which might be considered ‚Äòfeeling for‚Äô someone. Empathy, instead, is ‚Äòfeeling with‚Äô that person, through the use of imagination.

There is an important distinction between empathy, sympathy and compassion.

Both compassion and sympathy are about feeling for someone: seeing their distress and realising that they are suffering. Compassion has taken on an element of action that is lacking in sympathy, but the root of the words is the same.

Empathy, by contrast, is about experiencing those feelings for yourself, as if you were that person, through the power of imagination

Researchers have identified three types of empathy: cognitive empathy, emotional empathy and compassionate empathy.

- Cognitive empathy is understanding someone‚Äôs thoughts and emotions, in a very rational, rather than emotional sense.

- Emotional empathy is also known as emotional contagion, and is ‚Äòcatching‚Äô someone else‚Äôs feelings, so that you literally feel them too.

- Compassionate empathy is understanding someone‚Äôs feelings, and taking appropriate action to help

Internet Addiction


Internet addiction‚Äîsometimes called compulsive computer use, pathological internet use, and internet dependence‚Äîis not yet listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or ICD-11. Although internet addiction is slowly increasing. In simple terms, internet addiction is compulsive or frequent activity on the internet despite harmful consequences. These people are staying up all night and sleeping through their alarms. They‚Äôre missing school or work, neglecting their relationships, and disregarding other responsibilities like taking a shower or academic.

When it comes to internet addiction (and other types of addiction), there are both short-term and long-term effects, of which can prove harmful to the individual. Short-term effects include:

Incomplete tasks
Neglected responsibilities
Weight loss or gain
Backache
Neck pain

An individual with internet addiction might experience the above symptoms after only several sessions on the internet. Long-term side effects include:

Carpal tunnel syndrome
Vision problems
Damaged relationships
Loss of a job
Financial strain

As with most addiction disorders, there isn‚Äôt always a clear cause of internet addiction. However, there are likely multiple factors that contribute to the development of this disorder, some of which are rooted in nature and others that are rooted in nurture. It is the combination of genetics, neurodevelopmntal, environmental, social and family background play a crucial role in development of this disorder 


Treatment 

The first step in seeking treatment for internet addiction is recognizing that you have a problem. Hopefully, you have a better understanding of what this addiction entails after reading the symptoms listed above, and you can distinguish healthy internet habits from unhealthy internet habits.

Therapy: Different types of therapy can help with internet addiction but cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common approach. CBT focuses on helping individuals to acknowledge and change unhelpful thinking patterns as well as unhelpful behavioral patterns.

Medication: Some professionals insist that medications can help treat internet addiction‚Äîat least in instances where the individual is suffering with an underlying illness like depression or anxiety. These professionals believe that if the depression, anxiety, or other illness is dealt with, the internet addiction will resolve as well. In addition, research has shown that antidepressants as well as anti-anxiety medication do lead to decreased internet use.

Assessment & Management of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in an estimated 8% of men and 20% of women who are exposed to traumatic events. PTSD is a trauma- and stress-related disorder associated with significant psychosocial morbidity, substance abuse, and other negative physical health outcomes. The hallmarks of PTSD include exposure to a traumatic event; reexperiencing the event or intrusion symptoms; avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as a reminder of the trauma; negative mood and thoughts associated with the trauma; and chronic hyperarousal symptoms. Self-report questionnaires can assist clinicians in identifying anxiety problems associated with traumatic events. For patients who meet criteria for PTSD, trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy improve symptoms. Primary care physicians should monitor patients with PTSD for comorbid conditions such as substance abuse, mood disorders, and suicidality, and should refer patients to behavioral health specialists and support groups when appropriate.

The physician should educate the patient and his or her family about PTSD symptoms, other potential consequences of trauma exposure, and any comorbid conditions. Because patients often are reluctant to discuss traumatic events and may avoid treatment as a result, it is important to elicit patient preferences for treatment interventions. Other factors that influence treatment choices include locally available resources, individual physicians' comfort level and experience, and severity of symptoms.

Trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are first-line treatment options, but often must be combined with management of comorbid medical problems, such as chronic pain or sleep disturbance. Many persons with PTSD will attempt self-treatment methods, such as substance use. Physicians should have a low threshold for involving behavioral health specialists in PTSD management in the presence of comorbid substance abuse or psychiatric conditions. Patients who have substance use disorders should attempt a detoxification program, if necessary, and should be referred to a substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program.

Alcohol Dependence Syndrome ICD 11 (Alcohol Addiction) Alcohol Use Disorder - DSM V


Alcohol Use Disorder (Alcohol Dependence) Alcohol Addiction

Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.


As per ICD 11 

Alcohol dependence is a disorder of regulation of alcohol use arising from repeated or continuous use of alcohol. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use alcohol, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. These experiences are often accompanied by a subjective sensation of urge or craving to use alcohol. Physiological features of dependence may also be present, including tolerance to the effects of alcohol, withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of alcohol, or repeated use of alcohol or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if alcohol use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.

Essential (Required) Features:

A pattern of recurrent episodic or continuous use of alcohol with evidence of impaired regulation of alcohol use that is manifested by two or more of the following:

Impaired control over alcohol use (i.e., onset, frequency, intensity, duration, termination, context);
Increasing precedence of alcohol use over other aspects of life, including maintenance of health, and daily activities and responsibilities, such that alcohol use continues or escalates despite the 

occurrence of harm or negative consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational or scholastic consequences, negative impact on health);

Physiological features indicative of neuroadaptation to the substance, including: 1) tolerance to the effects of alcohol or a need to use increasing amounts of alcohol to achieve the same effect; 2) withdrawal symptoms following cessation or reduction in use of alcohol (see Alcohol Withdrawal), or 3) repeated use of alcohol or pharmacologically similar substances to prevent or alleviate withdrawal symptoms.

The features of dependence are usually evident over a period of at least 12 months but the diagnosis may be made if use is continuous (daily or almost daily) for at least 3 months.


The 11 Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder as per DSM V - Two symptoms should be there to diagnose 

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.

4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.

5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.

7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use.

8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a) A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; b) A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal); b) Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

The presence of at least two of these symptoms indicates an alcohol use disorder (AUD). The severity of an AUD is graded mild, moderate, or severe:

Mild: The presence of 2 to 3 symptoms.
Moderate: The presence of 4 to 5 symptoms.
Severe: The presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Examination Phobia (Exam Phobia) Exam Anxiety 

The term ‚ÄûPhobia‚Äü is described as an ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù fear. This fear is groundless and no logical explanation can be given. In that way examination phobia can be defined as having extreme irrational examination fear associated with avoidance of exam. 

Phobia can be diagnosed as uncontrollable anxiety in relation to heights, exams, needles, animals, sounds, visual elements. It‚Äôs an extreme, irrational fear. Some would define it as a mental disorder too. In the modern world, among many other phobias, some become victims of a rare kind of phobia called ‚ÄúExam Phobia‚Äù. A person affected with this phobia finds it harder to face various kinds of examinations.

Examination phobia is real and destructive. It is very natural as well as healthy way to approach examination. Examination pressure, to some degree is needed for the students for ensuring them to perform better, but too much pressure for obtaining high marks by the parents and teachers
sometimes becomes barrier for developing mental blockage and low performance. When the exam stress or pressure become ‚Äûphobia‚Äü students worry excessively, lack self confidence, develop different psychological reaction like frequent urination, fatigue, dizziness, sleep disturbances, headache, diarrhea and a number of other somatic complaints 

Emotional symptoms such as self-doubt, fear, stress, anger and physical symptoms such as sweating, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath can be seen in people who are affected by this phobia prior to an examination. These symptoms can affect the overall performance of an affected person. Panic attacks are also commonly seen among the people facing this fear.

Alcohol Use Disorder (Alcohol Dependence) Alcohol Addiction

Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism.


The 11 Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.

2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or recover from its effects.

4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol.

5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol.

7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use.

8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol.

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a) A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; b) A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol.

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to criteria A and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal); b) Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.

The presence of at least two of these symptoms indicates an alcohol use disorder (AUD). The severity of an AUD is graded mild, moderate, or severe:

Mild: The presence of 2 to 3 symptoms.
Moderate: The presence of 4 to 5 symptoms.
Severe: The presence of 6 or more symptoms.


One Standard Drink 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these:

12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol)
8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol)
5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol)
1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol)

Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder

Several evidence-based treatment approaches are available for AUD. One size does not fit all and a treatment approach that may work for one person may not work for another. Treatment can be outpatient and/or inpatient and be provided by specialty programs, therapists, and doctors.

Based on quality, quantity, duration of alcohol, comorbid conditions and severity of withdrawal treatment is planned as follows: -

Acute (detoxification) Mgmt: Is focused on minimizing the withdrawal symptoms and complications associated with alcohol such as seizures and delirium tremens. During the acute detoxification supportive treatment and benzodiazepines (diazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam) are choosen.    

Long-term (relapse prevention) Mgmt: 
Three medications are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to help people stop or reduce their drinking and prevent relapse: naltrexone (oral and long-acting injectable), acamprosate, and disulfiram. All these medications are non-addictive, and they may be used alone or combined with behavioral treatments or mutual-support groups.

Behavioral Treatments

Behavioral treatments, also known as alcohol counseling or ‚Äútalk therapy,‚Äù provided by licensed therapists are aimed at changing drinking behavior. Examples of behavioral treatments are brief interventions and reinforcement approaches, treatments that build motivation and teach skills for coping and preventing relapse, and mindfulness-based therapies.

Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry (CSP Ver 2.2)

Primary care doctors (PCDs) are often the first contact for patients with common psychiatric disorders, but the majority of them are ill equipped to handle the same leading to symptomatic treatment. Hence, an innovative digitally driven and modular-based Clinical Schedules for Primary Care Psychiatry (CSP Ver 2.2) was designed and implemented exclusively for practicing Primary care doctors of India

Common mental disorders (CMDs) form the significant bulk with a prevalence of around 10%, whereas severe mental disorders have a prevalence of 0.8%.] The treatment gap for most of the psychiatric disorders is around 80%. The total number of psychiatrists registered as members of the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) is approximately 9000. Going by this data, we have 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 populations, whereas the estimated desirable is more than 3 per lakh. Taking these data into consideration, India requires 36,000 psychiatrists. Hence, we have a deficit of around 27,000 psychiatrists

The second area to be taken into consideration is the distribution of the Indian population. Around 70% of the Indian population reside in rural areas, whereas the distribution of doctors/mental health professionals follows an opposite trend, with a concentration of specialists in urban areas.] This hampers the delivery of services to the majority of the Indian population. Primary care doctors (PCDs) are most often the first contact for these patients. Several studies have been conducted to study the prevalence of CMDs in patient population consulting PCDs and have shown that 17%‚Äì46% of this population need psychiatric care. However, majority of PCDs are ill equipped to handle the psychiatric disorders and provide symptomatic treatment which further lead to chronicity of illnesses in the population.

Integrating psychiatric care into primary health care appears to be a viable option to manage the above-mentioned roadblocks. Dysfunctional work patterns of PCDs are the reason for ‚Äúfunctional treatment gap‚Äù at primary care to provide psychiatric treatment but provide symptomatic treatment to them. Traditional classroom training (CRT) programs involving didactic lectures, video demonstrations, and PowerPoint presentations in group format are often conducted for these PCDs serving in government sector.

CSP is an all-in-one integrated, adopted, validated tool for PCDs to provide the first-line, safe, and effective pharmacotherapy for highly prevalent six psychiatric disorders at primary care which include tobacco addiction, alcohol (harmful and addiction), psychotic, depressive, anxiety (panic and generalized anxiety disorders), and somatization disorders (TAPPSAD).

It consists of the screener, classification of psychiatric disorders adapted for use in primary care settings, diagnostic criteria, referral points, and management guidelines for these six highly prevalent psychiatric disorders. 

The CSP screener consists of a questionnaire containing 21 culturally appropriate questions to screen patients for TAPDAS. CSP uses a cluster-based transdiagnostic classification of psychiatric disorders adopted for the use of PCDs. 

Clusters are CMDs cluster subdivided as (

(1) predominantly depressive, anxiety, somatization, or mixed symptoms; 
(2) psychotic disorder cluster subdivided as acute (cover acute psychosis and mania), chronic (schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders), or episodic (focus on bipolar disorder); and 

(3) alcohol disorders simplified as harmful (frequent and infrequent type) and addiction with simplified diagnostic criteria for primary care use. 

CSP version 2.2 designed by primary care psychiatry team at NIMHANS Bengaluru is available on request . 

CSP version 2.2 is available for downloadable at http://nimhansdigitalacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CSP-2.2-Oct-2018.pdf. 

Management guidelines in CSP include pharmacotherapy, brief counseling, and follow-up guideline along with strategies for referral guidelines. CSP screener has inbuilt pragmatism of real-world scenarios. It is adopted and validated with higher sensitivity and specificity at primary care

Strokes can happen to anyone, at any age. In fact, globally about one in four adults will have a stroke in their lifetime. Yet, most adults don‚Äôt know the F.A.S.T. warning signs of a stroke, and that stroke is largely preventable, treatable and beatable. Our power is knowledge and how we apply that knowledge starting today to defeat stroke.

FAST - To remember signs of stroke

F - Facial weakness (asymetry)
A - Arm weakness 
S - Speech problem 
T - Time to call ambulance 

When somebody has a stroke, every second that goes by is crucial. As brain tissue and millions of neurons begin to fade away, time could not be more precious. This year theme #Precioustime campaign aims to raise awareness of stroke signs and the benefits of timely access to emergency medical care.

Stroke affects 1 in 4 of us. This year 12.2 million people will have a stroke, 6.5 million - over half - will die as a result. Worldwide 110 million people have experienced stroke and live with impacts that can include severe physical disability, communication difficulties, changes in how they think and feel, loss of work, income and social networks.

Improving prevention and treatment of stroke and providing on going support with rehabilitation and life after stroke is essential.


Signs and symptoms of stroke 

NUMBNESS or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body

CONFUSION, trouble speaking or understanding speech

TROUBLE SEEING in one or both eyes

TROUBLE WALKING, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination

SEVERE HEADACHE with no known cause


Research has shown that early rehabilitative interventions can vastly improve functional outcomes. The ideal scenario is a client receiving therapy quickly after the stroke event. Sadly, this is not so in our society because there is an increased number of persons experiencing a stroke compared to the over-stretched and over-worked public health care system.

Stroke is a medical emergency and a global health threat that kills millions each year. Evidence is also growing that COVID 19 infection can increase our stroke risk. It is more important than ever that we all know the signs of stroke and call an ambulance immediately if we suspect stroke. Delays can devastate the brain, increasing the risk of death and the likelihood of severe long-term disability. The doctors community is united in our message - if you suspect stroke, don't stay at home, reach hospital fast

Alcohol Intoxication [Examination of a person with alcohol intoxication]

Alcohol intoxication, also referred to as drunkenness, ethanol intoxication, or alcohol poisoning in severe cases, is a temporary condition caused by drinking too much alcohol. The amount of alcohol needed for intoxication varies from person to person.

Alcohol intoxication is the direct result of alcohol consumption. The DSM-5 explains that alcohol intoxication is characterized by clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes that occur after drinking alcohol. Common symptoms include slurred speech, poor balance, dizziness, headache and nausea. 

The most common symptoms of alcohol intoxication are slurred speech, impaired coordination, trouble with balance and walking, involuntary eye movement, impaired attention or memory and loss of consciousness. The signs of alcohol intoxication are in alterations in a person's consciousness, cognition, perception, judgment, affect, or behavior. These can vary between people and depend on the severity of intoxication. Not only the effects of alcohol but also the complications caused by it ‚Äì such as accidents and violence ‚Äì are a major threat to a person‚Äôs health.

Alcohol intoxication can lead to a variety of injuries and dangerous medical conditions. Because alcohol impairs judgment, intoxicated individuals may make unwise or unsafe decisions. Gambling, unsafe sex, and physical confrontation can lead to injury or chronic health problems. Additionally, the poor physical coordination related to alcohol intoxication can make intoxicated individuals more likely to sustain injuries during every-day activities such as cooking, swimming or driving. 

Clinical Assessment of Intoxication

Recognizing the following signs and symptoms can help you assess the patient's level of intoxication:

General Physical Examination- Incoordination, Unsteady gait, Nystagmus

Writing test 
Reading test 
Walking along a straight line
Finger - nose test
Finger-finger test 
Picking up a coin from the floor
Romberg‚Äôs sign/test


General Appearance - Shouting, violent, disinhibited, disrobing, drowsy, unable to care for himself, vomiting, misbehaving, threatening, socially inappropriate behavior  

Motor Activity - Restless 

Speech - Slurred speech, louder speech than usual

Mood - crying, laughing, 

Thought - talking of big things 
 
Cognitive functions - Impairment in attention or memory, Stupor or coma

Treatment of Alcohol Intoxication

Although the majority of alcohol intoxication is naturally resolved with time, acute alcohol intoxication may require emergency medical care. The clinical goal in treating alcohol intoxication is to stabilize the patient‚Äôs clinical condition. Patients are usually treated with intravenous fluid to hydrate the patient and to correct hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalance. In some cases, medication is used to relieve nausea or vomiting. Special attention is paid to the patient‚Äôs respiratory, cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic and gastrointestinal health, as these can be damaged by severe alcohol intoxication

Perhaps the most important component of treating acute alcohol intoxication is to determine whether the alcohol intoxication is the result of a single incident or chronic alcohol abuse. This can be done through blood tests, to determine biological markers for alcohol dependence and patient interview. If the alcohol intoxication is the result of a single incident, brief counseling and education is usually sufficient to prevent continued harmful drinking practices. If the intoxication is the result of chronic alcohol abuse or dependence, the patient should be referred to alcohol treatment

Creative Thinking - An Essential Life Skills

Creative thinking is the ability to create something new for what is presented. This means providing fresh perspectives and new angles to a situation. As a result, we can obtain a solution that was absent earlier, or its need wasn‚Äôt even realized.

Creative thinking allows thinking out of the box and picking the most different ideas. This ability means to look at the current scenario and find new alternatives. The uncommon and unconventional ideas can help us in solving a problem. However, it is important to note that creative thinking can be useful beyond creative professions. Musicians, dancers, writers, designers require creativity. But a lot of other people and even professions can benefit from it. 

An idea that can spark change can further bring improvements and revolutions in every field. For example, teachers today give many projects or work to students that need them to brainstorm. 

Creative thinking refers to using abilities and soft skills to come up with new solutions to problems. Creative thinking skills are techniques used to look at the issue from different and creative angles, using the right tools to assess it and develop a plan.

The focus on creativity and innovation is important because most problems might require approaches that have never been created or tried before. It is a highly valued skill to have individually and one that businesses should always aspire to have among their ranks. After all, the word creativity means a phenomenon where something new is created.

Creative thinking is a skill and, like any other, it needs constant exercise to stay sharp. You need to regularly expose yourself to situations in which a new idea is needed and surround yourself with like-minded people to achieve this goal.

Such creative assessment strategies can be very helpful. Students are forced to think beyond the textbooks. As a result, a pool of unique ideas will be generated. This simple change in a method of evaluation can have a list of benefits.

While students will be able to learn according to their needs. Moreover, this can benefit the entire learning process.

Scamper Technique

SCAMPER was first introduced by Bob Eberle to address targeted questions that help solve problems or ignite creativity during brainstorming meetings. The name SCAMPER is acronym for seven techniques; (S) substitute, (C) combine, (A) adapt, (M) modify, (P) put to another use, (E) eliminate and (R) reverse. These keywords represent the necessary questions addressed during the creative thinking meeting.

During the need for critical thinking either alone or inside a group, forcing the mind to think in a specific flow can help emerging innovative ideas that won‚Äôt be possible to reach using a regular thinking flow. The SCAMPER technique aims to provide seven different thinking approaches to find innovative ideas and solutions.

The SCAMPER technique is one of the easiest and direct methods for creative thinking and problem-solving through a number of techniques, which can be learnt.

Telephone Counseling Skills (Essential Telecounselling Skills )

Telephone counselling/therapy is a structured therapeutic relationship, where the client and therapist speak on the telephone, rather than meeting in person. When clients arrange their telephone sessions, they are provided with a designated telephone number, which they call at the prearranged time, when their therapist will be available to speak to them. Sessions, like face-to-face ones, are with the same therapist, and usually take place at the same time, and on the same day, each week. The flexibility of telephone counselling/therapy provides access to therapy for clients for whom there are significant barriers to attending in person, or because of crisis, or stigma and many more reasons 

Counselling skills are interpersonal and technical traits that a counsellor uses to better understand and listen to their clients. Using these skills, a counsellor helps a client overcome obstacles that are preventing them from leading a happy life. These skills help you build rapport, establish trust and ensure that your clients feel heard and understood.

The core counselling skills are described below.

1. Attending
Attending in counselling means being in the company of someone else and giving that person your full attention, to what they are saying or doing, valuing them as worthy individuals.

2. Silence
Silence in counselling gives the client control of the content, pace and objectives.

This includes the counsellor listening to silences as well as words, sitting with them and recognising that the silences may facilitate the counselling process.

3. Reflecting and Paraphrasing
Reflecting in counselling is part of the ‚Äòart of listening‚Äô. It is making sure that the client knows their story is being listened to.

This is achieved by the helper/counsellor by both repeating and feeding a shorter version of their story back to the client. This known as 'paraphrasing'.

4. Clarifying and the Use of Questions
Questions in counselling are classed as a basic skill. The counsellor uses open questions to clarify his or her understanding of what the client is feeling.

Leading questions are to be avoided as they can impair the counselling relationship.

5. Focusing
Focusing in counselling involves making decisions about what issues the client wants to deal with.

The client may have mentioned a range of issues and problems and focusing allows the counsellor and client together to clear away some of the less important surrounding material and concentrate on the central issues of concern.

6. Building Rapport
Building rapport with clients in counselling is important, whatever model of counselling the counsellor is working with.

Rapport means a sense of having a connection with the person.

7. Summarising
Summaries in counselling are longer paraphrases. They condense or crystallise the essence of what the client is saying and feeling.

The summary 'sums up' the main themes that are emerging.

Ethical and Legal Issues in Telephone Counselling (Telecounselling)

The use of the telephone in counselling therapy may include sessions that are entirely conducted via the phone or may be combined with face to face interventions.  Telephone callers may include a variety of individuals. A caller may seek information from a counsellor about any issue or topic of interest including advice about a specific issue, general information, referrals, intervention or crises counselling (Ormand et al 2000). 

Counseling is a field of practice that exists and evolves at the intersection of ethics and law. The goal of this video is to review the legal and ethical aspects of the telephone counseling.

What is good and bad? is generally consider as ethical or moral. Telephone counseling is also subject to ethical and legal standards of the respective professionals providing services. 

ABCD of ethical issues in telephone counseling are - 

A. Counseling Relationship
B. Confidentially and Privacy in Counseling
C. Professional Responsibility
D. Relationships with Colleagues, Employers, and Employees
E. Evaluation, Assessment, and Interpretation
F. Supervision, Training, and Teaching
G. Research and Publication
H. Distance Counseling, Technology, and Social Media
I. Resolving Ethical Issues

Telephone counseling is no longer an unregulated field where non-scientific methods are used to heal non-existing emotional diseases. On the contrary, counseling has turned into an object of ethical and legal regulation, aimed at precision and non-ambiguity in counselors‚Äô relations with their clients.

Description of video 214:
Telephone Counseling Phases (Telecounselling Phases)

Telephone counselling is where you speak with your counsellor and receive your session over the telephone rather than face-to-face in the therapy room. As with face-to-face counselling, your counsellor will offer you space to talk through how you‚Äôve been feeling and support you to identify and make changes should you wish to do so.

A vital part of telephone counselling is that you feel heard and understood by your counsellor and that you understand the process. Most counsellors who offer telephone sessions offer an assessment over the phone. This is a valuable opportunity for you to find out more about how that counsellor works and for you to get a feel for telephone counselling. By the end of the assessment hopefully, you should have an idea of whether you would feel comfortable working with the counsellor.

Telephone counseling has five phases in each session 

1. Preparation
2. Introduction
3. Middle phase
4. Termination phase
5. Documentation and closing the session

There are times when telephone counselling would not be ideal as it may not be able to provide you with the right amount of support. If you are assessed and your counsellor expresses that they cannot offer you telephone counselling, don‚Äôt worry, this doesn‚Äôt mean that there is something wrong with you or that you won‚Äôt be able to access any support. In this instance, your counsellor may well give you information about other services for you to choose from that can offer the right type of help.

Telephone counselling may not be able to meet your needs if you experience significant difficulties talking and sharing feelings over the telephone. Nor would it be suitable if you assessed at ‚Äòat risk‚Äô. What this means is if you are at risk of harming yourself or other people. This is important because your counsellor has a responsibility to promote safety. If you are unsure about what this means or if it applies to you, please do ask your counsellor.

Role of School Teachers in Teaching Life Skills

According to the World Health Organization, life skills are:

‚ÄúA group of psychosocial competencies and interpersonal skills that help people make informed decisions, solve problems, think critically and creatively, communicate effectively, build healthy relationships, empathize with others, and cope with and manage their lives in a healthy and responsible manner‚Äù

According to several key organizations including UNICEF, UNESCO, and WHO, the following are the basic life skills:
Self-awareness
Critical thinking
Creative thinking
Decision making
Problem Solving
Effective communication
Interpersonal relationships
Empathy
Coping with stress
Coping with emotion

Of course, these skills overlap, with each of them aiding and supporting the others. There may also be other life skills and there may be subcategories of life skills within each of these basic life skill types. 

Imagine young people graduating from school with excellent scores but not knowing the first thing about coping with reality. What if they couldn't communicate effectively? Or couldn‚Äôt handle money issues and were always in debt?

It‚Äôs both alarming and all-too-common. That‚Äôs why parents and teachers alike should play an active role in preparing kids for the future.

Think of life skills as the building blocks or framework that allow students to apply the knowledge they acquire in school to real world problems and situations. Life skills provide children with important tools for development, such as independent thinking, how to socialize and make new friends, and how to take action in situations where their parents or teachers may not be around to help or intervene (dealing with a bully or personal insecurities and fears, for example.) Unlike motor skills and basic intelligence, executive function and decision-making skills are not innate but learned.

World Suicide Prevention Day 2023 [Creating hope through action] Need for collective action

World Suicide Prevention Day (WSPD), celebrated annually on 10 September, is organized by the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) and endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The event represents a global commitment to focus attention on suicide prevention.

The theme of WSPD 2022, ‚ÄúCreating hope through action,‚Äù reflects the need for collective, action to address this urgent public health issue. All of us- family members, friends, co-workers, community members, educators, religious leaders, healthcare professionals, political officials and governments- can take action to prevent suicide in the Region.

The overall goal of this day is to raise awareness about suicide prevention worldwide. Objectives include promoting stakeholder collaboration and self-empowerment to address self-harm and suicide through preventative action. These can be achieved through capacity building of healthcare providers and other relevant actors, positive and informative messaging aimed at the general population and at-risk groups such as young people, and facilitating open discussion on mental health at home, at school, in the workplace, etc. Those contemplating or affected by suicide are also encouraged to share their stories and seek professional help.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) a total of 1,64,033 people died by suicide in 2021 across the country, an average of nearly 450 daily or 18 every hour, with the figures reaching highest for any calendar year so far, according to official data. 


Suicide is a serious public health problem that can have long-lasting effects on individuals, families, and communities. The good news is that suicide is preventable. Preventing suicide requires strategies at all levels of society. This includes prevention and protective strategies for individuals, families, and communities. Everyone can help prevent suicide by learning the warning signs, promoting prevention and resilience, and a committing to social change.


Warning signs that someone may be at immediate risk for attempting suicide include:

Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves
Talking about feeling empty or hopeless or having no reason to live
Talking about feeling trapped or feeling that there are no solutions
Feeling unbearable emotional or physical pain
Talking about being a burden to others
Withdrawing from family and friends

Life Skills Education for Children and Adolescents (Life Skills Training)


Life skills can be defined as abilities that enable humans to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of life. They may also be called psychosocial skills, as they are psychological in nature and include thinking and behavioral processes. Others define life skills as behavioral, cognitive, or interpersonal skills that enable individuals to succeed in various areas of life

Research suggests that developing life skills may help reduce drug, alcohol, and tobacco use. It may also reduce aggression and violence. In addition to these bigger outcomes, life skills can just make life a bit easier. When we can regulate our emotions effectively and develop enduring, supportive relationships, we‚Äôre happier and healthier. This is why developing life skills is key not only to being successful in life, it‚Äôs key for our health and well-being.


According to several key organizations including UNICEF, UNESCO, and WHO, the following are the basic life skills (‚Äã‚ÄãPrajapati, Sharma, & Sharma, 2017):

Self-awareness
Critical thinking
Creative thinking
Decision making
Problem Solving
Effective communication
Interpersonal relationships
Empathy
Coping with stress
Coping with emotion

Of course, these skills overlap, with each of them aiding and supporting the others. There may also be other life skills and there may be subcategories of life skills within each of these basic life skill types. 


(WHO) defines Life skills as the abilities for adaptive and positive behavior that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life.

Life skill has been classified into three broad categories:

‚Ä¢ Thinking skills: Thinking skills are the skill that enhances the logical faculty of the brain using an analytical ability, thinking creatively and critically, and developing problem-solving skills and improving decision-making abilities.

‚Ä¢ Social skills: Social skills include interpersonal skills, communication skills, leadership skills, management skills, advocacy skills, co-operation and team building skills, etc.

‚Ä¢ Emotional skills: Emotional skills, involves, knowing and being comfortable with oneself. Thus, self‚Äìmanagement, including managing/coping with feelings, emotions, stress and resisting peer and family pressure

A relevant and proper implementation of life skill education is a need of an hour, for today‚Äôs society. Imparting life skills education to the students, can be helpful as it specifically addresses the needs of children, helps in motivating, providing practical, cognitive, emotional, social and self-management skills for life adjustments. On the whole, life skills education, have found to be an effective psychosocial intervention strategy for promoting positive social, and mental health of adolescents which plays an important role in all aspects such as strengthening coping strategies and developing self-confidence and emotional intelligence, as well as enhancing critical thinking, problem solving and decision making skills as has been well documented in the aforementioned studies. Thus, there
is, significance and importance of life skills education to be integrated into the regular school curriculum and given on a daily basis by a life skills trainer/ teacher/counsellor to enhance the mental health of students, equip them with better adapted skills to face the challenges of changing life situations and empower them to become fully functioning contributors to the host society in particular and the world in general.

World Mental Health Day 2022 ( WMHD 10 Oct 2022) 

10 October is World Mental Health Day

Theme - Make mental health & well-being for all a global priority

The overall objective of World Mental Health Day is to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health.

The Day provides an opportunity for all stakeholders working on mental health issues to talk about their work, and what more needs to be done to make mental health care a reality for people worldwide.

Many aspects of mental health have been challenged; and already before the pandemic in 2019 an estimated one in eight people globally were living with a mental disorder. At the same time, the services, skills and funding available for mental health remain in short supply, and fall far below what is needed, especially in low and middle income countries.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a global crisis for mental health, fueling short- and long-term stresses and undermining the mental health of millions. Estimates put the rise in both anxiety and depressive disorders at more than 25% during the first year of the pandemic. At the same time, mental health services have been severely disrupted and the treatment gap for mental health conditions has widened.

Growing social and economic inequalities, protracted conflicts, violence and public health emergencies affect whole populations, threatening progress towards improved well-being; a staggering 84 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced during 2021.

Stigma and discrimination continue to be a barrier to social inclusion and access to the right care; importantly, we can all play our part in increasing awareness about which preventive mental health interventions work and World Mental Health Day is an opportunity to do that collectively. We envision a world in which mental health is valued, promoted and protected; where everyone has an equal opportunity to enjoy mental health and to exercise their human rights; and where everyone can access the mental health care they need. 

This 10 Oct 2022 time to launch a campaign around the theme of "Making Mental Health & Well-Being for All a Global Priority". This will be an opportunity for people with mental health conditions, advocates, governments, employers, employees and other stakeholders to come together to recognize progress in this field and to be vocal about what we need to do to ensure Mental Health & Well-Being becomes a Global Priority for all.

Neurobiology of Post-traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD)

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop following exposure to a traumatic event, including terrifying or life-threatening situations such as sexual assault or natural disasters. The disorder is characterized by a reaction of intense fear, helplessness, or horror when the individual experiences, testifies about, or is faced with one or more events that involve death, severe wounds, or a threat to one's own or another's physical integrity. 

One of the most important symptoms of PTSD is the revival of the traumatic event, which has been interpreted as an inability to downregulate negative emotions. Neuroimaging studies that probed the ability to regulate emotions in healthy volunteers have found a pattern characterized by activation of the prefrontal cortex associated with a reduction in amygdala activity. This suggests an inhibitory prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit that underlies emotional regulation. The hypothesis that increased amygdala activation associated with PTSD results from dysfunction in the inhibitory mechanism exerted by the prefrontal cortex has been the topic of debate.

As neuroscience advances and the understanding of neurobiology improves, so too has insight into the etiology, pathogenesis, and neural substrates of PTSD. Increasingly, as with other psychiatric and neurological illnesses, PTSD is framed within the context of dysfunctional brain networks and circuitry. Non-invasive brain imaging has played a pivotal role in uncovering the neurobiological circuitry involved in psychiatric illness, driven by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can image brain anatomy. This technological revolution ‚Äì along with extensive preclinical work ‚Äì led to the neurocircuitry model of PTSD,13 which posited that the emergent behaviour and cognitive phenotypes of PTSD primarily arise from the interactions among three key neurobiological structures in the brain: the amygdalae, prefrontal cortices, and hippocampi. This theory states the following: that exaggerated amygdalae activity is responsible for maladaptive fear responses and conditioned associations with traumatic stimuli; that the frontal cortices do not sufficiently suppress reflexive fear and startle responses and fail to extinguish dysfunctional attention and orienting responses; and that atypical hippocampal functioning is responsible for the consolidation and recollection of episodic memories that underlie traumatic re-experiencing and nightmares. 

The studies provide evidence that the amygdala and prefrontal cortex exhibit distinct activation patterns in PTSD, thus supporting the model of a dysfunctional circuit. Inconsistencies in the literature may be attributable to distinct PTSD subgroups, different experimental approaches, different contrasts employed in neuroimaging studies, and small sample sizes.

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) Pseudo-seizures

Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is the most prevalent type of functional neurological disorder (FND), affecting 2-33 individuals per 100,000 population. Onset of PNES typically occurs during teen years or young adulthood, with higher rates observed in women compared to men.

These events ‚Äúconsist of paroxysmal alterations in motor, sensory, autonomic, or cognitive functions that are not associated with ictal epileptiform activity (EEG activity).

Individuals with PNES are often misdiagnosed with epilepsy and may not receive an accurate diagnosis for many years. Among patients referred to tertiary epilepsy centers with refractory seizures, an estimated 10%-40% of cases are ultimately diagnosed as PNES.

Although PNES symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of epilepsy on observation alone, some of the clinical features that have been more frequently noted in PNES vs epileptic seizures include rapid recovery as well as ‚Äúlonger duration, fluctuating course, asynchronous movements, pelvic thrusting, side-to-side head or body movement, persistently closed eyes and mouth, ictal crying, recall of ictal experiences and absence of postictal confusion

Nonetheless, it is important for clinicians to avoid making assumptions that patients with PNES are feigning their symptoms. ‚ÄúThe common mistake doctors make is assuming that patients are malingering and stopping the anti-epileptic can trigger status epilepticus 

The only way to prove or disprove PNES is by capturing the events on [video-electroencephalogram] VEEG, the gold standard in diagnosing PNES. These days, with smart camera phones, it is easier to get those videos at home and show it to the treating doctor.

PNES is highly prevalent, resembling ES on many levels and poses significant problems for physicians. PNES can be carefully differentiated from ES with respect to its demographics, prodromal symptoms, onset, ictal duration, semiology of the seizure and its associated symptoms, and associated psychiatric disorders. Efforts to integrate the current wealth of evidence and using a more structured and combined diagnostic approach should be done in order to increase the accuracy of PNES diagnosis.

Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS Scale)

Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome characterized by abnormal involuntary movements of the patient's face, mouth, trunk, or limbs, which affects 20%‚Äì30% of patients who have been treated for months or years with neuroleptic medications.  The AIMS test is used not only to detect tardive dyskinesia but also to follow the severity of a patient's TD over time. It is a valuable tool for clinicians who are monitoring the effects of long-term treatment with neuroleptic medications and also for researchers studying the effects of these drugs.

Precautions
The AIMS test was originally developed for administration by trained clinicians. People who are not health care professionals, however, can also be taught to administer the test by completing a training seminar.

Description
The entire test can be completed in about 10 minutes. The AIMS test has a total of twelve items rating involuntary movements of various areas of the patient's body. These items are rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0‚Äì4. The scale is rated from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Two of the 12 items refer to dental care. The patient must be calm and sitting in a firm chair that doesn't have arms, and the patient cannot have anything in his or her mouth. The clinician asks the patient about the condition of his or her teeth and dentures, or if he or she is having any pain or discomfort from dentures.


Results
The total score on the AIMS test is not reported to the patient. A rating of 2 or higher on the AIMS scale, however, is evidence of tardive dyskinesia. If the patient has mild TD in two areas or moderate movements in one area, then he or she should be given a diagnosis of TD. The AIMS test is considered extremely reliable when it is given by experienced raters.

Examination Procedure

Either before or after completing the examination procedure, observe the patient unobtrusively at rest (e.g., in the waiting room). 

The chair to be used in this examination should be a hard, firm one without arms.  Have the person remove their shoes and socks.  

1. Ask the patient whether there is anything in his or her mouth (such as gum or candy) and, if so, to remove it. 

2. Ask about the *current* condition of the patient's teeth. Ask if he or she wears dentures. Ask whether teeth or dentures bother the patient *now*. 

3. Ask whether the patient notices any movements in his or her mouth, face, hands, or feet. If yes, ask the patient to describe them and to indicate to what extent they *currently* bother the patient or interfere with activities. 

4. Have the patient sit in chair with hands on knees, legs slightly apart, and feet flat on floor. (Look at the entire body for movements while the patient is in this position.) 

5. Ask the patient to sit with hands hanging unsupported -- if male, between his legs, if female and wearing a dress, hanging over her knees. (Observe hands and other body areas). 

6. Ask the patient to open his or her mouth. (Observe the tongue at rest within the mouth.) Do this twice. 

7. Ask the patient to protrude his or her tongue. (Observe abnormalities of tongue movement.) Do this twice. 

8. Ask the patient to tap his or her thumb with each finger as rapidly as possible for 10 to 15 seconds, first with right hand, then with left hand. (Observe facial and leg movements.) [¬±activated] 

9. Flex and extend the patient's left and right arms, one at a time. 

10. Ask the patient to stand up. (Observe the patient in profile. Observe all body areas again, hips included.) 

11. Ask the patient to extend both arms out in front, palms down. (Observe trunk, legs, and mouth.) [activated] 

12. Have the patient walk a few paces, turn, and walk back to the chair. (Observe hands and gait.) Do this twice. [activated]

Neuro-Psychiatric Aspects of Epilepsy (Seizures)

Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders, affecting approximately 75 million people worldwide, and it is now recognized as a disorder of the brain characterized not only by recurrent seizures, but also by its neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences. 

The nature of the relationship between psychosis and epilepsy has been of great interest to psychiatrists for over a century. Epidemiologic studies point to a bidirectional relationships between epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. People with epilepsy are more likely to develop certain neuropsychiatric disorders, and those with these disorders are more likely to develop epilepsy. This relationship suggests the possibility of shared underlying pathophysiologies.

Mood and anxiety disorders are the most frequently reported psychiatric comorbidities with epilepsy, with a prevalence of 20% to 22%, however, in select populations, the prevalence can reach 50%. Reasons for the association are both biological and psychosocial. Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that brings about a number of social limitations and discriminations that lead to demoralization and poor self-esteem. Moreover, epilepsy and mood disorders seem to share a common neurobiology, with involvement of the limbic structures and the modulation of major neurotransmitter pathways by anticonvulsant medications. 

Compared with mood disorders, psychoses seem to be relatively rare in patients with epilepsy but represent serious complications that affect morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data indicate that the incidence of non-organic, non-affective psychoses, including schizophrenia and related disorders, is generally overrepresented in patients with epilepsy compared with the general population or those with other chronic medical conditions. The relationship between epilepsy and psychoses has strong neurobiological underpinnings related to the involvement of specific brain areas.

Epileptic seizures are characterized not only by the ictal phase but also by a number of behavioral manifestations that may precede or follow the seizure. Such peri-ictal, ictal or post-ictal symptoms may fail to meet temporal DSM criteria when too short-lasting. However, it appears that they are highly responsible for the atypical presentations of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy. The phenomenology of postictal psychoses is polymorphic, but most patients present with abnormal mood and paranoid delusions with mystic and religious content. Consciousness can be variably impaired (eg, from overwhelming confusion to totally clear sensorium). High levels of anxiety with a fear of impending death represent another typical symptom that may precipitate in episodes of violence, self-injury, or suicide if command hallucinations are present.

Postictal psychoses are characterized by spontaneous remission within days or weeks; antipsychotic drug treatment is only required to reduce mortality and morbidity. Finally, it has to be kept in mind that in a minority of cases, postictal psychoses may evolve into chronic interictal psychosis.


In this video, I have made attempt to  review the neuropsychiatric aspects of epilepsy, impact of antiseizure medications and therapeutic options for treatment. Diagnosis and treatment involve close collaboration among a multidisciplinary team.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) structured assessments

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness with lifetime prevalence of 1-3%. It is the fourth-most common psychiatric illness and a leading cause of disability. OCD is associated with significant impairment in functioning, quality of life and disability. If untreated, OCD is a chronic illness with a waxing and waning of symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of long-term naturalistic prospective studies demonstrated that nearly a half of patients experience remission with much higher rates of remission in Indian patients compared to those in the west. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment may improve outcomes. Despite OCD being a common mental illness, most seek treatment after several years of suffering. Those who suffer from OCD tend to be secretive about their symptoms and suffer from shame and embarrassment. Less than a third of OCD sufferers receive appropriate pharmacotherapy and even less receive evidence-based psychotherapy.

In routine clinical practice, use of structured / semistructured interviews and rating scales may not be necessary. They are optional. However, they may be used when the clinician needs supplementary information. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) is the most widely used severity rating scale for OCD in both adults [9] and children [10] and is considered a gold standard instrument to measure severity of OCD. It is a 10-item observer-rating scale, also available as self-rated instrument. It measures the overall severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms for the preceding week. The YBOCS is a global measure of symptoms and does not provide severity of individual symptom dimensions. A total score of ‚â• 16 is considered to be indicative of clinically significant OCD. The YBOCS severity scale also has an associated symptom check list of 15 categories of obsessions and compulsions including miscellaneous symptoms. The checklist elicits both current (1 month) and past symptoms.

On the YBOCS item-11 insight scale, the insight is graded as follows: 0 = excellent (fully rational thinking), 1= good insight (readily acknowledges absurdity or excessiveness but has some lingering doubts), 2 = fair insight (reluctantly admits absurdity, but waivers; has some unrealistic fear but no fixed conviction), 3 = poor insight (overvalued ideas; maintains they are not unreasonable or excessive, but acknowledges validity of contrary evidence), and 4 = lack of insight (delusional). A higher score on the Y-BOCS item-11 indicates poorer insight.

Formulating a treatment begins with correct diagnosis of OCD as per the DSM or ICD classificatory systems. When feasible a structured clinical interview is recommended to obtain a comprehensive account of patient's problems. Once a diagnosis is established, a detailed assessment of symptom profile is required generally. Family members often accommodate patient's rituals and contribute to poor outcome. In most severely ill patients, an elaborate family assessment may be needed. Once assessment is complete, short-term and long-term goals of treatment have to be established. Enhancing treatment adherence is a vital aspect of formulating a treatment plan. It is important to educate patients about lag in the onset of action of drugs and that improvement may occur over several months of continuous treatment. Brief education about basic principles of psychotherapy should be explained if psychotherapy is being planned.

Breaking Bad News in Pediatric Care: How to Communicate Bad News to  Parents Regarding their Child

Breaking bad news to patients or to their family members is one of the most difficult responsibilities in the practice of medicine. Medical school offers little formal training in how to discuss bad news with patients and their families.

Breaking bad news about life-threatening and possibly terminal conditions is a crucial part of paediatric care for children in this situation. Communication can have a positive or negative effect on their parents‚Äô perceptions of the decision-making process. It is important to understand how communication of bad news concerning children with life-threatening conditions might be improved to better suit the needs of parents and children.  

Lack of sufficient training in breaking bad news is a handicap to most physicians and health care workers. Adherence to the principles of client-centered counseling is helpful in attaining this skill. Fundamental insight of the patient is exploited and the bad news is delivered in a structured manner, because the patient is the one who knows what is hurting him most and he is the one who knows how to move forward.

Rabow and McPhee  developed a practical and comprehensive model, synthesized from multiple sources, that uses the simple mnemonic ABCDE

A - Advance Preparation 

B - Build a therapeutic relationship 

C - Communicate well 

D - Deal with patient and family reactions 

E - Encourage and validate emotions

Despite the challenges involved in delivering bad news, physicians can find tremendous gratification in providing a therapeutic presence during a patient's time of greatest need.

Ethical and Legal Issues in Plagiarism [Research Misconduct]  

Plagiarism is the practice of taking someone else‚Äôs work or ideas and passing them off as one‚Äôs own. In simple words, Plagiarize is to copy another person‚Äôs idea, words or works and pretend that they are your own. Stealing is a crime although it is easy to identify when someone is stealing money or tangible items, stealing words, illustrations, tables, figures, thoughts or ideas can be harder to recognize. This type of stealing is called ‚ÄúPlagiarism‚Äù, and it is happening more frequently these days. The some of the reasons of plagiarism are laziness, fecklessness, and ignorance. But there are the cases when plagiarism is committed inadvertently, one may choose to write on the same topic and may even convey the same ideas and express them similarly in his paper. 

Plagiarism usually discovered by scholars and researchers during the continuance of their research work. Plagiarism is one of the most severe violations of academic writing. It may have serious consequences. 

Not everyone who plagiarizes starts out with the goal of stealing someone else's work. Sometimes, plagiarism is simply the result of poor planning and a few bad, panicked decisions. Don't fall victim to the plagiarism trap. 

Plagiarism shares some elements with copyright infringement. Both situations can involve the unauthorized use of intellectual property. 

How to avoid Plagiarism?

- Start early and give time for writing 
- Keeping track of your sources
- Cite while you write 
- Citing your sources correctly
- Use quotation marks
- Paraphrasing but you need to cite 
- Using a plagiarism checker
- Learn the English language

Mental Illness and Health Insurance (Medical Insurance for mental illness) Health insurance for Psychiatric illness

 Mental Illness Cover in Health Insurance (Medical Insurance Cover for Mental illness) a topic of concern for persons with mental illness.

Mental Illness is a topic that has always been pushed behind closed doors. There has been a huge stigma around mental illness. Mental illness was excluded from health insurance earlier but now the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) asked insurance companies to make provisions to cover mental illness.  It was a welcome step as mental health has a large scope, especially in India. So mental health insurance is for real now and will not be excluded from your health insurance anymore.

One of the important provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, in section 21 (4), is the inclusion of ‚Äúmental illnesses‚Äù for health insurance coverage. This is a progressive step toward considering mental illness at par with physical illness, which will, in turn, ensure better access to mental health care. In this context, this video summarizes the concept of ‚Äúhealth insurance‚Äù and then goes on to talk about various provisions for persons with mental illnesses in India. I have also discussed some of the relevant concerns that may arise in this context. Whereas insurance for mental illness is a welcome step toward achieving universal health coverage, there is a need to deliberate on various issues before we can achieve that.

Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 section 21 (4) says, ‚ÄúEvery insurer shall make provision for medical insurance for treatment of mental illness on the same basis as is available for treatment of physical illness.‚Äù Soon after the enactment of the said act, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA), issued a notice directing all insurance providers to include psychiatric illnesses under the ambit of medical insurance. The IRDA is the governing body under whose purview the insurance providers come. These developments are really welcome. However, few of issues need to be kept in mind 

(a) unlike the physical illnesses, mental illnesses do not have an assured way of ‚Äúrisk-based calculation‚Äù. There is no reliable data is available  

(b) Inpatient care in psychiatry involves interventions which may not fit entirely into the category of medical interventions such as rehabilitation in half-way home, long-stay home, day care rehab, vocational rehab and so forth. 

(c) Outpatient based a session of psychoeducation, a family therapy session, psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, coginitive retraining and so forth will be covered or not   

(d) Health Insurance for personality disorders such as ASPD, BPD and so forth

(e) Health Insurance for substance use / dependence for recreational drugs and illegal drugs is debatable 

(f) Health Insurance for intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental disorders, SLD, ODD, Autism and so forth needs to discussed   

(g) The management of physical ailments is clearly defined and facilitated by the patient willingly agreeing to continue the same. In many PMIs, the treatment is given involuntarily, and it is complicated by issues of noncompliance, which may lead to multiple relapses and increased number of hospitalizations. Another dilemma which may arise in the context of MHCA 2017 is that PMIs now have the right to make an ‚Äúadvance directive‚Äù in which they may specify the way they wish to be treated as well as the way they wish not to be treated. What if a person wishes to be treated in a manner that is more expensive than the other equally efficacious alternatives available?

(h) Suicide attempts are common in many psychiatric illnesses. However, should insurance cover them is not a simple enough dilemma

(i) The health insurance company gets access to medical records of persons with mental illness. However, there are no guidelines or regulations regarding how much medical records should be shared or what information can be shared. If the medical records are shared with the insurance company, will it be the contravention of the MHCA, 2017 section 23, right to confidentiality? These issues need to be clarified for the proper implementation of health insurance for mental illness

These issues need to be sorted out before insurance covers expenses for those with psychiatric disorders

Covering families with health insurance is a necessary act if the financial risks are to be guarded, particularly for the poor. In India, now mental illnesses have been given equal priority with other physical ailments and have been included for consideration of health insurance. Consequently, they figure prominently in the state-sponsored health insurance/assurance schemes.

Laws for Senior Citizens - Legal framework for protection of Senior Citizens - Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007

Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007

This 2007 legislation makes it a legal obligation for children and heirs to provide maintenance to senior citizens and parents. It provides simple, speedy and inexpensive mechanism for the protection of life and property of the older persons. This Act also provides for setting up of old age homes for providing maintenance to the indigent older persons.

WHO IS A PARENT: Parent means father or mother whether biological, adoptive or step-father or step -mother, whether or not father or mother is a senior citizen.

WHO IS A SENIOR CITIZEN: Any citizen of India who is aged 60 years and above.

WHO ARE THE CHILDREN : Children means and includes son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter but does not include a minor.

WHO ARE RELATIVES : Relative is any legal heir of childless senior citizen who is not a minor and is in possession of or would inherit the property of the senior citizen after his death.

A tribunal is constituted as per the Act to provide enforce the remedy of maintenance and other reliefs from their children / relatives or any other person liable to pay maintenance. Kolar Tribunal is housed in Assistant Commissioner‚Äôs office.

Interim maintenance can also be awarded.

WHO CAN APPLY:
1. Any parent(s) or senior citizen

2. Authorised registered organisation on behalf of parent(s) or senior citizen.

3. The tribunal can also suomotu take cognizance.

Notice to be served to children / relatives and application for maintenance to be resolved within 90 days of notice. If such children/relative fail to comply the orders of the Tribunal, fine Lavy WARRANT can be issued for the due amount. If the respondent voilets the order, can be imprisoned for one month or until payment is made, whichever is earlier.

The application can be filed before the Tribunal in the district, where the applicant resides or last resided or where children or relative resides. Normally proceedings shall be in the presence of children/ relative against whom relief is sought and if need be ex-parte decision can be made. Representation by lawyers is prohibited.

Maintenance includes provision for food, clothing, residence, medical attendance and treatment. The Tribunal can also order children/relative to pay monthly allowance as maintenance; maximum amount being Rs. 10,000/- per month.

If not satisfied, the senior citizen/parent can file appeal before Appellate tribunal.

Protection of life and property of Senior citizen
This act also protects the senior citizen who has transferred either moveable or immovable property, as gift or otherwise, with the condition that basic amenities and physical needs of Senior Citizens are taken care of. In case this condition is not met, such transfer of property shall be deemed to have been made by fraud, coercion or undue influence and the Tribunal can declare such transfer as void and the senior citizen can reclaim his property. The concerned police personnel will ensure priority in dealing with these types of cases.

Abandoning a senior citizen in any place by a person who is having the care or protection of such senior citizen is a criminal offence and such person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or both. Offence is made cognizance and police can directly investigate the matter on complaint.

The Maintenance & Welfare of Parents & Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019 is on the agenda of the Union Government. This Bill for the maintenance of senior citizens and parents was first approved by the Union Cabinet in December 2019 but is yet to be cleared by the Parliament. 

The Bill provides for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens to ensure their basic needs, safety and security. 

The Maintenance & Welfare of Parents & Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019 introduces several changes to The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. Here are few key points:

The amendment bill widens the definition of children. Under the Act, the definition of children includes children and grandchildren, excluding minors. However, the Amendment Bill has added step-children, adoptive children, children-in-law, and the legal guardian of minor children to the definition.

The definition of parents in the amendment bill not just includes biological, adoptive, and step-parents but parent-in-laws and grandparents also.

The definition of maintenance has also been expanded in the amendment bill to include the provision of healthcare, safety, and security for parents to lead a life of dignity. 

One of the most important changes that the amendment bill seeks to introduce is the removal of the cap of Rs 10,000 as maintenance charge.

Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board and Informed Consent in Medical procedures   

Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board [2015] UKSC 11 is a landmark decision, in which the UK Supreme Court has found in favour of informed consent on the part of a patient who is considering, or being advised, to undergo medical treatment.

In Montgomery, a case originating from Scotland, the plaintiff was a pregnant woman of short stature who suffered from injection dependent diabetes. Women suffering from diabetes are likely to have babies that are larger than normal, which brings with it an increased risk of approximately 10 percent of shoulder dystocia during delivery. Shoulder dystocia, whereby the width of the baby‚Äôs shoulders are such that they cannot pass down the birth canal and so the baby cannot be born vaginally unless the baby‚Äôs shoulders are somehow freed (or the baby returned to the womb and an emergency caesarean section performed), is an obstetric emergency for the mother, with serious potential adverse consequences for the baby.


In 1999, while delivering her baby vaginally, shoulder dystocia occurred. It is recorded in the judgment that it took some 12 minutes between the baby‚Äôs head appearing and the effecting of delivery. As a result, the baby was deprived of oxygen. In consequence, he suffered cerebral palsy, with all four of his limbs being affected.

The judgment in Montgomery emphasizes dialogue with the patient, and the fact information conveyed must be comprehensible before informed consent is taken. 

The Montgomery judgment records the changes in (British) society and that ‚Äúpatients are now widely regarded as persons holding rights, rather than as the passive recipients of the care of the medical profession‚Äù.

Comparison of ICD 11 vs ICD 10 from Psychiatric Disorders Perspective

This video provides a brief overview of the changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11 regarding the classification of mental, behavioral, or neurodevelopmental disorders. These changes include a new chapter structure, new diagnostic categories, changes in diagnostic criteria, and steps towards dimensionality. 

The ICD-11 Mental, Behavioral or Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MBND) chapter contains 21 disorder groupings compared with 11 disorder groupings in ICD-10

The introduction of new diagnostic categories, there were also changes in the diagnostic criteria for previously existing diagnoses. For example, the diagnostic threshold for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was raised in ICD-11 by defining three core symptoms that should be present in all cases: re-experiencing the traumatic event as vivid intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares; avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event, situations or people reminiscent of the event; persistent perceptions of heightened current threat. There is some evidence indicating that the prevalence of ICD-11 PTSD is lower than the prevalence of ICD-10 PTSD

For ICD-11 , the categorical approach of ICD-10 was largely maintained. Yet, dimensional expansions regarding severity, course, and specific symptoms were added for some diagnoses. These dimensional expansions of categorical diagnoses mirror clinical practice, in which dimensional information (eg, severity of illness) is regularly taken into consideration for selecting treatments. 19 A large shift towards dimensionality concerned personality disorders. The different personality disorders in ICD-10 were replaced with a single personality disorder diagnosis in ICD-11 which is characterized by problems in functioning of aspects of the self (eg, identity) and/or interpersonal dysfunction (eg, managing conflict in relationships). The ICD-11 personality disorder diagnosis is further differentiated according to severity into mild, moderate, and severe. The diagnosis may optionally be specified by the presence of one or multiple maladaptive personality traits: Negative affectivity, detachment, dissociality, disinhibition, anankastia and Borderline pattern. Whereas a different, more complex, dimensional approach to personality disorders was deemed as not feasible in the development of DSM-5 there was a strong focus on clinical utility and simplicity in the revision of the personality disorders grouping in ICD-11 

Another shift towards dimensionality concerned depressive episodes. In ICD-11 , depressive episodes in depressive or bipolar disorders may be described in detail by using qualifiers indicating the presence of specific symptoms: the melancholic features qualifier, the anxiety symptoms qualifier; the panic attacks qualifiers, and the seasonal pattern qualifier. Additionally, depressive episodes can be described according to severity (mild, moderate, or severe) and remission status (in partial or in full remission). For moderate and severe depressive episodes, the presence of psychotic symptoms may also be indicated

The development of the ICD-11  Mental, Behavioral or Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MBND) chapter was characterized by a focus on clinical utility, global applicability, and scientific validity. Thus far, mental health professionals‚Äô evaluations of the ICD-11 are relatively positive. Changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11 include the introduction of new diagnoses, the refinement of diagnostic criteria of existing diagnoses, and notable steps in the direction of dimensionality for some diagnoses. However, there was no paradigm shift from ICD-10 to ICD-11 .

World No Tobacco Day 2022 Theme [Antitobacco Day 2022] Tobacco‚Äôs threat to our environment

The World Health Organization's  Tobacco Free Initiative is committed to raising awareness of the threat posed by the global tobacco epidemic, to protect our environment, and public health at large. The steps that can be taken is to make aware of the environmental hazards of tobacco, reduce tobacco production, consumption and save lives

WHO today announces the 2022 global campaign for World No Tobacco Day - ‚ÄúTobacco: Threat to our environment."  . The campaign is aimed to raise awareness among the public on the environmental impact of tobacco ‚Äì from cultivation, production, distribution and waste. It will give tobacco users one extra reason to quit. 

The campaign will also aim to expose tobacco industry‚Äôs effort to ‚Äúgreenwash‚Äù its reputation and products by marketing themselves as environmentally friendly.

Around 3.5 million hectares of land are destroyed for tobacco growing each year. Growing tobacco contributes to deforestation, especially in the developing world. of Deforestation for tobacco plantations promotes soil degradation and ‚Äúfailing yields‚Äù or the capacity for the land to support the growth of any other crops or vegetation.

With about 90% of all tobacco production concentrated in the developing world, tobacco has an immensely uneven impact on different socioeconomic groups. In low- and middle-income countries, many farmers and government officials see tobacco as a cash crop that can generate economic growth, however, the short-term cash benefits of the crop are offset by the long-term consequences of increased food insecurity, frequent sustained farmers‚Äô debt, illness and poverty among farm workers, and widespread environmental damage in low- and middle-income countries.

The tobacco industry has also invested heavily to ‚Äúgreenwash‚Äù their environmentally damaging practices by reporting environmental impact and funding environmental corporate social responsibility projects and organizations. Their smoke screen is only able to work due to lack of objective data as well as limited and inconsistent legislation at international and local levels.

Reducing tobacco consumption needs to be identified as a key lever for achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals, not just those directly related to health.

The campaign calls on governments and policy makers to step up legislation, including implementing and strengthening existing schemes to make producers responsible for the environmental and economic costs of tobacco product waste.

Theis year campaign calls on governments and policy-makers to step up legislation, including implementing and strengthening existing schemes to make producers responsible for the environmental and economic costs of dealing with tobacco waste products. WHO also recommends that countries fully ban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, including advertising CSR programmes, in accordance with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).

Bedside Approach to Neuropsychological Assessment [Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment on OP Basis] 

This video presents a clinically useful approach to obtaining the history, performing the mental status examination and bedside neuropsychological assessment.

A thorough history and collating information from multiple informants are necessary to get the complete picture of the patient's illness, disability, deficits and functionality of the patient. Assessment revolve around the cognitive domains of executive function, attention, memory, visuospatial function, emotional, language, and behavior. 

While the history inquires about the patient‚Äôs abilities related to these domains as they pertain to his or her life, the neuropsychological examination tests the integrity of these domains in a clinical setting and is, therefore, a formal part of the neurologic examination. The overall goal is to determine if performance on each domain is normal or impaired. Longitudinal assessments provide additional information to determine if a change has occurred. 

Over the years, neuro-psychological tests have evolved from simple screening measures to more in-depth evaluations that are reflective of the increased understanding of the clinical and cognitive features of the various types of brain lesions.

Laboratory and imaging biomarkers are being developed for accurate diagnosis of neurobehavioral disorders, yet few are currently available for clinical use. Moreover, not all centers have access to these potential tools. Practicing clinicians are therefore left primarily with their skills of history taking and examination.

With limitations on both time and resources, an efficient deductive process is required to obtain and distill the key elements from the history, elemental neurologic examination, bedside neuro-psychological assessments and ancillary investigations to determine the etiology of a patient‚Äôs cognitive impairment. 

The neuropsych assessment may be required for a variety of reasons, including issues relating to capacity (competency) for informed decision making, prognosis, rehabilitation, pre & post intervention assessment, capacity for independent living versus the need for assisted living, or an elucidation of cognitive strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning (be they medical, rehabilitative, pharmacological, or other).

The documentation must contain elements that indicate the timing of the onset, type of progression, presenting symptom, and duration. The history should expand on this and obtain the chronologic progression of the patient‚Äôs abilities in other cognitive domains, including changes to his or her personality or behavior and ability to function in both instrumental and basic ADLs.  Administration of the neuro-psychological assessment requires that the chosen assessment tool adequately examines the patient‚Äôs primary symptom in addition to the other cognitive domains. If not, additional bedside tests should be added to the assessment. Alternatively, the clinician can administer a single test that includes a more in-depth assessment than the brief screening measures.

Admission of person with mental illness as independent (volunteer) patient 

‚ÄúIndependent (volunteer) admission‚Äù refers to the admission of person with mental illness, to a mental health establishment, who has the capacity to make mental healthcare and treatment decisions or requires minimal support in making decisions 

All admissions in the mental health establishment shall, as far as possible, be independent admissions except when such conditions exist as make supported admission unavoidable.

The International Classification of Diseases [ICD 11] World Health Organization and ICD 11

The World Health Organization (WHO) Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) has now come into effect, with the latest update going online since Jan 2022. 

The ICD provides a common language that allows health professionals to share standardized information across the world. It is the foundation for identifying health trends and statistics worldwide, containing around 17 000 unique codes for injuries, diseases and causes of death, underpinned by more than 120 000 codable terms. By using code combinations, more than 1.6 million clinical situations can now be coded.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has long been the main basis for comparability of statistics on causes of mortality and morbidity between places and over time. Clinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in primary, secondary and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics support payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services research. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables large scale research.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a common language that allows health professionals to share standardized information across the world. All Member States are encouraged to follow their commitment to move on to ICD-11 documented with their approval of ICD-11 at the 72nd meeting of the World Health Assembly in 2019, and use the most current version of ICD for recording and reporting mortality and morbidity statistics both nationally and internationally.   

As a classification and terminology ICD-11: 

a)allows the systematic recording, analysis, interpretation and comparison of mortality and morbidity data collected in different countries or regions and at different times and

b) ensures semantic interoperability and reusability of recorded data for the different use cases beyond mere health statistics, including decision support, resource allocation, reimbursement, guidelines and more

ICD-11 Highlights

- Legally mandated health data standard (WHO Constitution and 
Nomenclature Regulations).

- In effect from January 2022.

- Conceptual framework independent of language and culture.

- Integration of terminology and classification.

 In 2022, reporting of mortality data according to ICD-11-MMS will commence, with a transition period of at least five years. The nature, timing, and complexity of implementation for morbidity coding will vary from place to place. In general, the transition will be most complex in places in which ICD is used widely, in multiple systems, and underlies processes such as activity-based funding.

Intoxication as a defense for a Crime (Sec 85 & 86 IPC) Substance use & crime - insanity defense 

Intoxication is a defense available to criminal defendant on the basis that, because of the intoxication, the defendant did not understand the nature of his/her actions or know what he/she was doing unless the thing which intoxicated him without his knowledge or against his will.


The defense of intoxication typically depends on whether the intoxication was voluntary or involuntary and what level of intent is required by the criminal charge. Under the Indian Penal Code the criminal liability under intoxication is mentioned under section 85 and 86.

Section 85: Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will. ‚Äî Nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong, or contrary to law: provided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.

Section 86: Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.‚ÄîIn cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him without his knowledge or against his will.

One important distinction to make in an intoxication defense case is the distinction between a voluntary intoxication and involuntary intoxication. In other words, if somebody slipped something in another person‚Äôs drink causing them to become intoxicated and that person does something illegal, they would have a very good defense.

If on the other hand someone of their own volition drinks a bunch of alcohol gets in a car and kills someone, they would have a much more difficult time trying to use intoxication to defend themselves.

The intoxication defense is usually not going to be a very good defense when it comes to a criminal case.  The judiciary is not going to let people get away with crimes just because they got themselves intoxicated. No prudent lawyer will argue for Sec 86 defense. 

Approximately 50% of violent offences and property offences are committed after drugs or alcohol have been consumed, and although consumption may not be directly linked to the offence, there is often a strong association between the two. (Read this article Quazi Haque & Ian Cumming, Intoxication and legal defences, Advances in Psychiatric Treatment 2003, vol. 9, 144‚Äì151)

Intoxication with alcohol and drugs is commonly associated with criminal offending. The relationship between intoxication and criminal culpability is complex and may be of psychiatric relevance, especially if a mental
condition legal defense is being considered.

Medical Professionals as an expert witness in the court of law 

The doctor, in the course of his professional work, could be summoned to be a witness in court proceedings, to act as either a witness of fact or a medical expert witness. The doctor may need to testify under oath in a court of law giving evidence regarding a particular patient that he treated or had a doctor-patient relationship with. In such a situation the doctor is acting as a witness of fact.

Meanwhile, a medical expert witness would not have been involved in the care of the patient in question, but possesses special knowledge and experience of a subject that enables him to give opinions and draw conclusions relevant to the case, to impartially and objectively assist the court. 

The medical expert witness is expected to articulate the standard of care in medical negligence cases and standard of professional conduct and give an opinion supported by good arguments and evidence. To be effective, a medical expert witness needs to be trained to acquire competence. Untrained, unskilled and incompetent expert witnesses would mislead the courts and tribunals to inappropriate conclusions and make dispute resolution complex, wasteful and costly.

Experts opinion should be demonstrative and supported by convincing reasons. Court cannot be expected to surrender its own judgement and delegate its authority to a third person, however great.

In India medical evidence can be taken as a corroborative value of evidence, which is conferred from Sec 45 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The medical evidence is regarded as opinion evidence plays an important and indispensable part of the evidence, particularly in cases of offences committed against women. 

The court cannot form a correct judgement without the help of a person with special skills or experience in a particular subject. When the court needs an opinion in a subject which requires special assistance, the court calls an expert, a specially skilled person. The opinion given by a third person is considered as relevant facts if the person testifying is an expert.

Expert is defined under section 45 of The Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The court needs an expert to form an opinion upon:

- Foreign law
- Science & Art
- Identity of Handwriting
- Identity of finger impression
- Electronic evidence

Only in the expertise in the above-said fields, a person‚Äôs opinion is considered to be an expert opinion. If a field not mentioned above requires an opinion, it is not considered as an expert opinion.

Principles & Practice of Forensic Psychiatry 

Forensic Psychiatry is a subspecialty of psychiatry in which scientific and clinical expertise is applied in legal contexts involving civil, criminal, correctional, regulatory or legislative matters, and in specialized clinical consultations in areas such as risk assessment or employment.  Forensic psychiatry deals with issues at the interface of penal or criminal law as well as with matters arising in evaluations on civil law cases and in the development and application of mental health legislation.

Because of its dual role in psychiatry and in law, the practice of forensic psychiatry is fraught with ethical dilemmas worldwide. A forensic psychiatrist is first of all a clinician with theoretical and practical knowledge of general psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, and experience in making rational decisions from a clearly stated scientific base. In law, forensic psychiatrists must know the legal definitions, the legal policies and procedures, the legal precedents relating to the question or case at hand.

Ethical medical practice and treatment in psychiatry are based on the concept of first do no harm. However, this cannot, and does not, apply to forensic cases where there is no doctor‚Äìpatient relationship and the forensic psychiatrist may indeed cause harm to the examinee.

Psychiatrists who take on a forensic assessment role for patients with whom they have a therapeutic relationship face competing ethical principles that must be acknowledged and managed. Treating psychiatrists who have conducted a risk assessment on their patient and provide forensic opinion regarding the results in court, or at a Review Board or other tribunal, may provide opinions that may reflect negatively on their patient, thereby potentially damaging the therapeutic relationship. The adversarial nature of legal proceedings where the psychiatrist acts in this dual role must be accepted and managed in a professional manner. Further, the potential for bias in the psychiatrist‚Äôs opinion stemming from the nature of the therapeutic relationship must be accepted and
acknowledged. As such, treating psychiatrists are especially cautious when acting as an expert witness for their patients. When acting in this dual role, the dual role should be highlighted including educating the trier of fact about the potential for bias in their opinions so that appropriate weight can be given to the opinion.

Honesty, objectivity and the adequacy of the clinical evaluation may be called into question when an expert opinion is offered without a personal examination of the evaluee. Forensic psychiatrists refrain from making public statements regarding direct diagnosis of or conclusions about public figures in the absence of formal assessment. If such an assessment is conducted, any public disclosure would require informed consent. 

Forensic psychiatrists must have knowledge of courtroom activity and must possess an ability to communicate their findings clearly and to the point and to do so under the difficult situation of cross examination. The double knowledge in psychiatry and law defines the subspecialty of forensic psychiatry and provides the ethical foundations for its practitioners. This double knowledge should be reflected from the very beginning in the way the forensic psychiatrist first agrees to get involved in an evaluation, the way the forensic psychiatrist approaches the person to be evaluated, and the caveats that have to be provided. At this stage, the most important issue for the forensic psychiatrist is to make sure that the person subject of the evaluation is not misled into believing that, because the psychiatrist is a medical doctor, the relationship to be unfolded is one of physician-patient, in which the doctor is expected to do the best for the patient and always to act to maximize the patient's benefit, while reassuring the patient that privacy and confidentiality are protected. In forensic psychiatry the relationship is one of evaluation, where the foundation of neutrality demanded from the evaluator, and the fact that the evaluator is in no position to reassure the person on matters of confidentiality or privacy could mean that negative findings will endanger the interests and cause harm to the person being evaluated, regardless of this person's health and the evaluator being a physician. Because of this, forensic psychiatrists may even be implicated in the criminalization of mentally ill persons

How to write a management plan in psychiatry long cases? 

Psychiatrists use treatment planning as a tool to accurately diagnose, effectively treat and rehabilitate patients. Without a clear plan in place, it can be hard to track progress, stay organized and keep a record of individual patient care. Every patient needs individually tailored treatment. When a psychiatrist creates a comprehensive treatment plan specially designed to meet their patient's needs, they give their patient directions towards growth and healing.

Treatment plans usually follow a simple format and typically include the following information:

A diagnostic formulation - The patient's personal information, relevant history, past, personal and family history

- A diagnosis (differential diagnosis) 

Focus, Locus and Modus of treatment 
Focus - of treatment 
Locus - where is the treatment planned? Inpatient or outpatient 
Modus - Modality of treatment (medications,  ECT,  rTMS,  VNS,  tDCS, psychotherapy, family therapy, and so forth)


- High-priority treatment goals

- Measurable objectives

- A timeline for treatment progress

- Rehabilitation plan

World Health Day 2022 (Our Planet, Our Health) #HealthierTomorrow  

It is celebrated annually to draw attention to a specific health topic of concern to people all over the world. In our planet, climate change is impacting human lives and health in a variety of ways. It threatens the essential ingredients of good health - clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply, and safe shelter - and has the potential to undermine decades of progress in global health and wellbeing 

Areas with weak health infrastructure ‚Äì mostly in developing countries ‚Äì will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond to climate change. WHO supports countries in building climate-resilient health systems and tracking national progress in protecting health from climate change.

Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health ‚Äì clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter.

Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food and energy-use choices results in improved health, particularly through reduced air pollution. 

The direct damage costs to health (i.e. excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation), is estimated to be between USD 2-4 billion/year by 2030.

Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity, and health professionals worldwide are already responding to the health harms caused by this unfolding crisis.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that to avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.5¬∞C. 

Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.5¬∞C is not considered safe, however; every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people‚Äôs lives and health

Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions.

Although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate-sensitive health risks. However, scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to human-induced warming, and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats.

Fitness to stand trial (Competency to stand trial)

An assessment that is done to test the mental abilities of individuals to defend their case is called, 'fitness to stand trial' or 'competence to stand trial'. Thus, competency or fitness to stand trial refers to a defendant's ability to understand and rationally participate in legal proceedings and to defend himself.

Competency to stand trial is legally unrelated to the defendant's mental state at the time of the alleged crime. In other words, the issue of competency relates to the defendant's state of mind during criminal proceedings, not during the commission of the crime. The determination of whether a defendant is competent is left to the judge. The judge must decide competency before trial, as soon as reasonably possible after it comes into question. The prosecution, defense counsel, and even the court can raise the issue at any time. Competency usually comes into doubt when the defendant's behavior indicates a lack of understanding. So, psychiatrically incompetent accused are usually sent for treatment and will be treated until become competent.

There are several provisions to deal with the accused of unsound mind. There is a presumption under the law that every person is capable of entering the trial and can defend himself. If the accused wishes to take the defence of competency, then the burden to prove incompetence lies on himself.

The competency to stand trial is a legal construct. It deals with the mental capacity of an individual who is affected by some mental illness, mental retardation or any other neurological conditions. The mental disorder may be because of different reasons such as Depression, Schizophrenia, Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease, Epilepsy, Mental retardation, Substance-abuse disorders and disorders of childhood and adolescence. Not every person who is suffering from some mental disease is not competent to trial. The degree of mental illness matters a lot. It depends on the circumstances of each case. The assessment is done by psychiatrists.

Psychotherapy in Child Sexual Abuse Survivors [Counseling in Child Sexual Abuse]

Sexual abuse is an abuse of power. It involves sexual activity forced on a child by either an adult or an older, more powerful child. Sexual abuse interrupts normal personality, sexual development in children and forces them to deal with intensive thoughts, feelings and experiences they are not ready for and that are often overwhelming, emotionally, psychologically and physically. Because the victims are powerless to stop the abuse and aren't old enough to understand what is happening, they may suffer permanent emotional damage even if there's no physical damage. 

Therapists or Counsellors are people trained to listen and respond to their clients and to help them make changes in their lives. They may have different titles such as psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, school counselors, or art therapists. The important thing is that they are trained in trauma counseling and also in child sexual abuse. Therapy or Counselling is especially important when a child is betrayed by a person close to him/her, is struggling with the effects of the abuse, and/or when s/he is not supported by the family when s/he discloses the abuse.

Not all children who experience childhood sexual abuse will develop diagnosable mental health conditions. However, children who are victims of childhood sexual abuse are at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as for other mental health conditions. Awareness of the specific symptoms of PTSD and other childhood sexual abuse‚Äìrelated problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, behavior problems) is important to ensure that children are assessed accurately and receive the appropriate treatment. For example, the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD can be mistakenly attributed to hyperactivity stemming from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reexperiencing symptoms (nightmares and flashbacks) may be misdiagnosed as early psychosis, and negative cognitions and beliefs about the world may be mistakenly attributed solely to depression. Providers also must recognize that comorbid conditions, such as depression and PTSD, are not uncommon.

Children often believe that because they've been abused, they are different. This may make them feel isolated. So, role of therapists is to normalize the child's life. 


Majority of trauma-focused treatments that have empirical support for children and adolescents are cognitive-behavioral therapies, with several common cross-cutting elements. These elements include psychoeducation about trauma and its impact (e.g., PTSD); affective modulation skills, such as relaxation and controlled breathing; gradual exposure to trauma memories; and cognitive processing to address unhelpful or inaccurate cognitions, such as guilt or self-blame. Gradual exposure appears to be a particularly important treatment element, given the cumulative evidence regarding its specific impact in reducing PTSD symptoms. In brief, this involves repeated exposure to details of the trauma as a way to extinguish trauma-related emotional and behavioral responses. This treatment strategy also helps improve cognitive processing of the traumatic event(s), which has been demonstrated to facilitate recovery. As noted with most child mental health treatment interventions, involvement of a supportive caregiver in trauma-focused treatments can be another important element related to positive outcomes, including reduced dropout, increased family engagement, and improved parent-child relationships

While several evidence-based trauma-focused treatments exist, the most effective and widely disseminated psychotherapy intervention for children and adolescents to date is trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In brief, trauma-focused CBT is a structured, components-based, time-limited (i.e., 12‚Äì20 therapy sessions) intervention that includes education about trauma and its impact, strategies to promote relaxation and positive coping skills, techniques to address inaccurate or unhelpful thoughts related to abuse, gradual exposure to enable children to share details of their experience and process their trauma-related thoughts and feelings, joint parent-child sessions to increase open communication about the abuse and its impact, and parenting skills to manage problematic child behaviors that may predate or be exacerbated by the childhood sexual abuse.

Childhood sexual abuse affects a significant minority of children and adolescents and heightens risk for myriad acute and long-term consequences. Initial screening for children across mental health and other health care settings can increase early identification of those who need further evaluation or treatment services. Optimal treatments, specifically those that directly target the childhood sexual abuse and associated symptoms, are associated with positive long-term outcomes for this vulnerable population.

Intercountry Marriage and Divorce (Overseas Marriage & Divorce) NRI Marriage and Divorce 

Marriages to Overseas Indians or to foreigners are like any other marriage and may go through the same ups and downs except that these marriages are governed not only by the Indian legal system but also by the far more complex rules of private international law involving the legal system of the other country. The aggravated risks in such marriages occur due to the woman being isolated far away from home in an alien land, facing constraints of language, lack of knowledge of local police and legal system, lack of support network of friends and family, and readily available monetary support and a place to take shelter in.

The problems in Overseas marriages may take the shape of women being abandoned because of various reasons. It may be before she is taken to the foreign country of her husband‚Äôs residence or going to the foreign country but coming back within a year, either sent back or forced to flee. 

Cases of spouses learning later that they were given false information on any or all of the following: spouse‚Äôs job, immigration status, earning, property, marital status, woman‚Äôs husband obtaining an ex-parte decree of divorce in the foreign country behind her back without her knowledge, woman being abandoned in the foreign country with absolutely no support or means of sustenance or escape and without even the visa to stay on in that country, a woman going to court for maintenance or divorce but repeatedly encountering legal obstacles related to jurisdiction of courts, service of notices or orders, or enforcement of orders, woman being coaxed to travel to the foreign country of the man‚Äôs residence, getting married there and later discovering that Indian courts have even more limited jurisdiction on such marriages, have also come to light. 

A small percentage of cases of Overseas Indian husbands being harassed wrongly have also been reported, where an Indian lady given false complaints against the husband NRI / or his family members were accused of domestic violence, sexual abuse, rape, child sexual abuse, and so forth. These are serious offenses and males also have been suffering in such marriages.   

The Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India circulated a draft booklet for the guidance of persons interested in Overseas Indian marriages in April 2019 which was discussed with different stakeholders including state governments, lawmakers and law enforcers, counselors, and NGOs during the National Consultation. This booklet has now been discussed in various consultations and discussion forums.

The Apex court‚Äôs perspective

In the case of Neeraja Sharaph vs. Jayant V. Saraph (1994),  the court has emphasized on the need to consider legislative safeguarding of the interests of women and also suggested the following specific provisions:

- If Marriage between an NRI and an Indian woman has been solemnized in India then it may not be annulled by any foreign court.

- Adequate alimony should be paid to the wife by the husband, in the case of divorce.

Divorce has given by a foreign court and its legal validity in India (Y. Narasimha Rao & Others Vs. Y. Venkatalakshmi 1991 )

The Supreme Court of India held that both on the issue of jurisdiction and the ground on which the foreign decree was passed were not in accordance with Hindu Marriage Act under which the marriage took place. The Supreme Court, therefore, held that the decree was not enforceable in India

There are many occasions wherein an ex-parte decree is obtained from foreign courts against the other spouse on unreasonable and fraudulent grounds. It has been a persistent question in the context of NRI divorces,
whether such decrees could be enforced in India.

Section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) lays down the grounds on which a foreign decree would not be enforced in India:

- If it has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction.

-  If it has not been given on the merits of the case.

A refusal to recognize Indian law if such Indian law was applicable to the case

- Where the judgment was not in accordance with natural justice;

- If the judgment was obtained by fraud;

-  If it upholds a claim which is a result of the breach of any law in force in India.

Psychological Impact of Divorce on Children (Mental Health Consequences of Parental Conflict)

Divorce may increase the risk for mental health problems in children and adolescents. Regardless of age, gender, and culture, children of divorced parents experience increased psychological problems. Divorce may trigger an adjustment disorder, depression, anxiety and substance use in children. But, studies have also found depression and anxiety rates are higher in children from divorced parents. 

Research has documented that parental divorce/separation is associated with an increased risk for child and adolescent adjustment problems, including academic difficulties (e.g., lower grades and school dropout), disruptive behaviors (e.g., conduct and substance use problems), and depressed mood

Divorce is inarguably intensely distressing for children. Outside the territory of family, because of the label of divorce, the child faces tough time attempting to be accepted by a narrow- minded society. In socioeconomic attainments, children who experience their parents' divorce have lower educational prospects than children from intact homes. Within the family, the obvious effects are on the physiological behavior of the child.

Separation/divorce also raises legal concerns bearing on the well‚Äêbeing and custody of children. The ‚Äúbest interests of children‚Äù is the prevailing custody standard, and ‚Äúbest‚Äù typically is interpreted in psychological terms (as opposed to, for example, economic ones). Mental health professionals and others may become involved, willingly or unwillingly, as expert witnesses in custody contests. Alternatively, some professionals promote or offer alternative dispute resolution, such as mediation. Mental health professionals also can play a critical role in advising parents, and perhaps in the development of law and policy.

Despite the fact that divorce is tough on families, staying together for the sole sake of the children may not be the best option. Children who live in homes with a lot of arguing, hostility and discontentment may be at a higher risk for developing mental health issues and behavior problems.

Child Custody Assessment in Divorce Proceedings(Child Custody Evaluation)


Child custody is an issue that typically arises from incidents such as divorces, annulments, and legal actions that involve children. However, the issues involving the custody of the child will be determined on what the courts see as the most positive for the child‚Äôs interest.

In case of divorce, it is the Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings that will determine which parent gets child custody. In most cases, parents with minor children i.e. under 18 years of age are required to file for custody in case of divorce or annulment.

The natural guardian of the child has the right to custody of the child, but the right is not absolute, and courts are expected to consider the welfare of the minor child. 

This is a common situation in Indian society, where during divorce cases, there is a fight over the money for maintenance i.e. money to be paid by the stable and earning partner to the other. One of the tactics used is to get custody of the child so that they don‚Äôt need to pay maintenance to the other partner since they are taking care of the child. Such situations are a reality but the law prioritizes the best interests of the child.

The cases where the child is bribed present complications, but no one can escape the court. Also, the legacy of property succession on the child is a common interest among the fighting parents. However, the custody of a child doesn‚Äôt imply the inclusion of any property in the name of the child. This is uncontested even in cases of live-in relationships or registered wedlocks.

The court considers:

Financial stability of the custodial parent

Their mental and physical well-being;

The child‚Äôs comfort with the said parent, especially while growing up;

The intention of the custodian (any Malafide, i.e. Wrong or false intention that may harm the child);

That no specific gender has the right on the child over and above the welfare of the child;

The judge has the full right to decide what is best for the child. The child may also choose for themselves;

It is not the child over whom parents can fight over or claim. It is only the child‚Äôs welfare, growth, and safety;

The child is not a source to inherit the property in cases of divorce and maintenance;

Through its decision, the court makes sure that the child is not used and their healthy development is ensured;


Custody in India is not a hard and fast concern, and judges decide on a case-to-case basis. The welfare of the child is of paramount relevance in matters relating to child custody. A child is not a chattel nor is he/she an article of personal property to be split in equal halves.

Legal Issues in Child Custody (Child custody disputes)

When a couple seeks divorce for various reasons, if the child or children are minors, the legal right to keep and look after the child/ children is called Child Custody.  

The mother and father both have an equal right to the custody of a child. Who gets the custody of the child, however is a question which the court decides upon. While the statutes are conflicting when it comes to personal laws as opposed to secular enactment in the form of The Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, the court of competent jurisdiction strives to strike a balance between the two, all the while holding the welfare of the child as the paramount importance. However, just because the custody of a minor has been awarded to one parent, it does not mean that the other parent cannot see or be in contact with the child. The courts in India are very strict to ensure that a child gets the affection of both the parents. The other parent gets visitation rights, the conditions of which are determined by the court.

The Indian Law, while keeping in mind the parents‚Äô right to the custody of a child, holds the welfare of the child as the most important factor of consideration when deciding upon who gets the custody of a minor child.

 What Are The Factors That Constitute ‚ÄúWelfare‚Äù Of A Child

Welfare of the child, broadly, includes the following factors:
- Safe-keeping of the child
- Ethical upbringing of the child
- Good education to be imparted
- Economic well-being of the guardian
- Spiritual / social / ethical / moral wellbeing 
- Family background 
- Family Support
- Child's wish  

The child custody laws in India are evolving and now all of them have adopted the uniform practice of keeping the child‚Äôs best interest in mind.

First among the factors is the welfare of the child, which includes a safe environment for the upbringing of the child. The ethical background and mental condition of the applicant is important to be considered while giving custody of the minor child. A balance has to be struck between the attachment and sentiments of the parties towards the minor children and the primary aspect of the welfare of the minors, which is of paramount importance, (V. Srinath Prasad vs. Nandamuri Jayakrishna, (2001) 4 SCC 71). 

Even Orders pertaining to custody of children passed by consent can be varied by the court, if the welfare of the child demands deviation from the original order. (Rosy Jacob v. Jacob A. Chakramakkal, (1973) 1 SCC 840).

On the other hand, if the child is at an age where they can understand the situation, their opinion is also considered by a Court while granting custody. This is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, (Nil Ratan Kundu v. Abhijit Kundu, (2008)

Under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 the custody of a child aged under five years should ordinarily be with the mother. The Indian courts have time after time taken view that the mother is always the best and the most suitable custodian of the child. The general rule followed by the Courts is that the custody of a boy or an spinster girl below the age of 18 years and above the age of 5 years shall be given to the father, as he is the natural guardian.

The Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court and other courts in India have reiterated time and again that in the proceedings for custody of a minor, the welfare of the minor is the only consideration, irrespective of the claims of the parties to the custody.

Parental Alienation Syndrome

Parental Alienation Syndrome (‚ÄòPAS‚Äô) is a situation in which one parent uses strategies, sometimes referred to as brainwashing, alienating, or programming to distance a child from the other parent during divorce proceedings. 

PAS is a term coined by Richard A. Gardner, Psychiatrist in the year 1985. In his article ‚ÄòRecent Trends in Divorce and Custody Litigation‚Äô, Gardner introduced the concept of PAS for the first time. Gardner was prompted to theorise this syndrome due to the high instance of sexual abuse allegations during divorce. Usually arising out of divorce, the syndrome is an important consideration for custody conflicts. The syndrome has been described as a psychological disturbance in which children are obsessed with unjustified denigration of a parent. It is used as an argument in child custody battles, to say that the child is biased against one parent due to this syndrome.

Parental Alienation Syndrome has the potential to become an important debate in India today, especially due to the recognition given to it by the apex court recently. The argument made in this regard is that PAS should not be admissible as scientific evidence. In India, however, due to there being no standards for admissibility of scientific evidence under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, there is an increased chance of use of such unfounded theories in the courts. This needs to be resisted until, it is well established scientifically and also in our culture. This PAS may come in the way and may play a role by potentially disregard  ‚Äúthe best interests of the child‚Äù doctrine.

Preliminary Assessment of Child in Conflict with Law (Juvenile Justice Act, 2021)

Form can be downloaded from - https://www.nimhanschildproject.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Preliminary-Assessment-Report-Proforma.pdf 

For doing Preliminary Assessment there is a basic condition to be full filled. Conditions are mention as under 

1. A juvenile has completed the age of 16 years.

2. A juvenile has alleged to commit a Heinous offence.

Now question come to our mind that what is a heinous offence. The Said definition is defined under the act in section 2(33). 

2(33) "heinous offences" includes the offences for which the minimum punishment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law for the time being in force is imprisonment for seven years or more;"

JJ board has to do preliminary assessment in regards to:-

[i] the mental and physical capacity of the child to commit the offence.

[ii] the ability of the child to understand the consequences of the offence; and

[iii] the circumstances in which the child allegedly committed the offence.

Now the board has to do preliminary assessment keep above factor in mind. To come out with the conclusion board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts. Board can refer the juvenile to Psychologist or psycho-social worker or other expert depending on the fact of the case. Board has to find out whether child is capable of doing crime or he has knowledge of consequences of it and under which circumstances he has done this. After considering the report of all the expert board has to pass order whether the juvenile is treated as an adult or child. Keeping in mind that the Preliminary assessment is not a trial.

Sec 15 of the JJ Act 2021 

15. Preliminary assessment into heinous offences by Board.-

(1) In case of a heinous offence alleged to have been committed by a child, who has completed or is above the age of sixteen years, the Board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence, and may pass an order in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 18

For preliminary assessment, the Board may take the assistance of experienced psychiatrist or psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.

Explanation.-For the purposes of this section, it is clarified that preliminary assessment is not a trial, but is to assess the capacity of such child to commit and understand the consequences of the alleged offence.

(2) Where the Board is satisfied on preliminary assessment that the matter should be disposed of by the Board, then the Board shall follow the procedure, as far as may be, for trial in summons case under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974): Provided that the order of the Board to dispose of the matter shall be appealable under sub-section (2) of section 101: Provided further that the assessment under this section shall be completed within the period specified in section 14.

The preliminary assessment is a barrier and it in safeguard for the juvenile. Because in the act Every child is presumed to be innocent. Moreover, this provision is also consonances with victimology because if the crime is very heinous then juvenile may be treated as an adult and transfer to children court where he will get the imprisonment as per the Section -21 of the JJ Act-2015. 

It is crucial for us to see that the Act has been meant for the ‚Äòprotection and care of children‚Äô, as the very name suggests. However, trying a child as an adult will not only be derogatory towards the mental health of that child but, is also defeats the very aim of enacting this Law. If the Act expressly mentions that children are ones who are below 18 and all children are by default devoid of any mala fide or criminal intentions, there is no scope left to conduct a preliminary assessment and then treat a child ‚Äòaccordingly‚Äô.

The Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 was enacted with a view to ‚Äúconsolidate and amend the law relating to children alleged and found in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection by catering to their basic needs through proper, care, protection, development‚Ä¶‚Äù The provisions focus on adopting a child-friendly approach in adjudication and disposal of matters. Further, it seeks the rehabilitation and social re-integration of children in their best interests to allow them a fresh chance at life.

Section 3 enlists the various (sixteen) general principles of law which are required to be followed in the administration of the Act. Prominent among these are: the principle of presumption of innocence wherein all children are presumed to be innocent of any criminal intent, the principle of dignity and worth, the principle of best interest, the principle of non-waiver of rights, the principle of repatriation and restoration, the principle of a fresh start and the principle of natural justice.

Background

The Delhi gang-rape in 2012 was an unfortunate incident which shook the heart of the nation and struck a raw nerve.  The incident also ignited national discourse on the question of juvenile delinquency as one of the prime accused in the case was a juvenile, just few months from becoming 18yrs. The fact that this accused was tried in a juvenile court, thus escaping a death sentence, triggered a massive outcry on the inadequacy of the juvenile law to treat cases where such heinous crimes had been committed.

The infrastructure of child care institutions currently in place is not enough for carrying out proper implementation and there is a severe dearth of human resources. Instead of acting upon public uproar, the government should have ascertained its responsibility and dealt with the crumbling juvenile frameworks. Juvenile homes must be created in a manner where delinquents have the opportunity to tune themselves with the rest of the society. They must receive the opportunities to reform and be educated, to be ready to make the plunge back into civilised society and live an honourable life.


It is the need of the hour to bring about reforms in the way our juvenile justice system works. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 however, is not the answer to this puzzle. Enabling the trial of children as adults and penalising them effectively destroys their lives in such a manner that does not even afford them a chance to reform themselves for mistakes they committed as na√Øve children.

The Surrogacy (Regulations) Act, 2021

The main objective behind this legislation is to prohibit commercial surrogacy, while only allowing altruistic surrogacy to take place. The Parliament of India passed two important legislations for the regulation of the practice of surrogacy and assisted reproductive technologies in India. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 


Though they are similar legislations, the Surrogacy Act has been passed as a separate legislation primarily for protection of the rights of the surrogate mother in the process. Since practices part of the Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Act do not specifically require the participation of a third party (a surrogate), several other methods of obtaining a pregnancy like gamete (sperm or oocyte) donation, in-vitro fertilization and gestational surrogacy are included in the ART Act 2021.

REGULATION OF SURROGACY AND SURROGACY PROCEDURES  

Altruistic surrogacy is defined in the legislation as surrogacy in which no money or remuneration except medical expenses are provided for the surrogate mother by the couple. Surrogacy where the selling or buying of a human baby is involved is called commercial surrogacy and is banned in the country by way of this legislation.

The legislation also lays down specific eligibility criteria for both the couple opting for surrogacy and the surrogate mother. The couple in question is required to have a ‚Äúcertificate of essentiality‚Äù which includes a certificate of proven infertility of one or both persons, a Court order on the parentage and custody of the child born through the surrogate, and insurance cover for the surrogate mother for 16 months including post-partum delivery complications.


Additionally, the couple has to include a man between the ages of 26 to 55 years and a woman of 25 to 50 years of age. Both have to be Indians, married for at least five years, and should have no biological, adopted or surrogate children (unless the child is Mentally/ physically challenged or has a life-threatening disorder). The strict criteria for anyone opting to be a surrogate mother are also laid down in the legislation. The woman in question must be ever married (married at least once in her life) and should have her own child. She should be between 25 to 35 years of age and a close relative of the couple opting for surrogacy. Any woman agreeing to be a surrogate, cannot be a surrogate more than once in her life and at the time she should be certified for medical and psychological fitness.


The legislation also mentions that written and informed consent of the surrogate mother is necessary ahead of the procedure for surrogacy and that the surrogate can withdraw her consent anytime before the implantation of the embryo. The act further restricts the couple opting for surrogacy from abandoning the child under any circumstances after his/her birth.

REGULATION OF SURROGACY CLINICS

The legislation deals extensively with the regulation of surrogacy clinics in the country and restricts any surrogacy clinic from allowing commercial surrogacy. The legislation also bans the surrogacy clinics from advertising in print and electronic media and conducting sex selection or determination procedures.

NATIONAL AND STATE SURROGACY BOARDS

The legislation entails the requirement for setting up of National and State Surrogacy Boards. 

OFFENCES AND PUNISHMENT

The following acts are recognized as offences under the law and attract the corresponding punishment:

Undertaking or advertising commercial surrogacy 

Imprisonment extending to ten years and fine extending to Rupees ten lakhs

Abandoning, disowning or exploiting the child born out of surrogacy - Imprisonment extending to ten years and fine extending to Rupees ten lakhs

Exploiting the surrogate mother - Imprisonment extending to ten years and fine extending to Rupees ten lakhs

Selling, importing or trading in human embryos or gametes for the purpose of surrogacy - Imprisonment extending to ten years and fine extending to Rupees ten lakhs

Conducting sex selection - Imprisonment extending to ten years and fine extending to Rupees ten lakhs


Any medical practitioner who commits any offence under the Act shall be punished with imprisonment extending upto five years and fine extending upto Rupees ten lakhs. If a subsequent offence is reported by the same person, he shall be reported to the appropriate authority and the State Medical Council for the suspension of his registration for five years.

Any couple who initiates commercial surrogacy shall be punished for the first offence with imprisonment upto five years and fine upto Rupees five lakhs and for any subsequent offence with imprisonment upto ten years and fine upto Rupees ten lakhs.

All the offences mentioned under the legislation are non-bailable.

Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 2021 (Abortion Laws in India),  [MTP Act 2021] MTP act 1971  and Rules 2021

The new Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act 2021 expands the access to safe and legal abortion services on therapeutic, sound medical and social grounds to ensure universal access to comprehensive care. The amended law will increase the ambit and access of women to safe abortion services and will ensure dignity, autonomy, confidentiality and justice for women who need to terminate pregnancy.

Key Provisions of the MTP Amendment Act, 2021:

Termination due to Failure of Contraceptive Method or Device:

Under the Act, a pregnancy may be terminated up to 20 weeks by a married woman in the case of failure of contraceptive method or device. It allows unmarried women to also terminate a pregnancy for this reason.

Opinion Needed for Termination of Pregnancy:

1. Opinion of one Registered Medical Practitioner (RMP) for termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks of gestation.

2. Opinion of two RMPs for termination of pregnancy of 20-24 weeks of gestation.

3. Opinion of the State-level medical board is essential for a pregnancy to be terminated after 24 weeks in case of substantial foetal abnormalities.


Upper Gestation Limit for Special Categories:

Increases the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women, including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women (differently-abled women, minors, among others)


Confidentiality:

The ‚Äúname and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed‚Äù, except to a person authorised in any law that is currently in force.

Abortion to be performed by doctors:

The Act requires abortion to be performed only by doctors with specialisation in gynaecology or obstetrics.

According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021, these categories include survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest, minors and women whose marital status changes during an ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce) and women with physical disabilities.

The new rules also cover mentally ill women, cases of foetal malformation that has a substantial risk of being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped and women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government. According to the new rules, a state-level medical board will be set up to decide if a pregnancy may be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of foetal malformation and if the foetal malformation has a substantial risk of it being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped.

The function of the Medical Board shall be to examine the woman and her reports if she approaches for medical termination of pregnancy and provide the opinion with regard to the termination of pregnancy or rejection of a request for termination within three days of receiving the request.

The Board has also been tasked to ensure that the termination procedure, when advised by it, is carried out with all safety precautions along with appropriate counselling within five days of the receipt of the request for medical termination of pregnancy.

The changes consider the advances in medical technology, simplify requirement of providers, increase upper gestation limit for termination of pregnancy under specific conditions, and remove the gestation limit for cases that could burden the health system. The goal is to strengthen access to comprehensive abortion care without compromising dignity, autonomy, confidentiality, and justice for women who need safe and quality services. It is imperative now that the recent changes, rules, and regulations are adequately communicated and widely disseminated to not just service providers but also other stakeholders, such as programme managers, NGOs and the community.

Breaking Bad News: Spikes Protocol for Healthcare Professionals in Virtual Mode  (Digital Mode) 

Conveying bad news is a skilled communication, and not at all easy. The amount of truth to be disclosed is subjective. A properly structured and well-orchestrated communication has a positive therapeutic effect. However, this pandemic has challenged the healthcare professionals in providing healthcare and also breaking bad news in real world. 


The COVID-19 global pandemic has introduced novel challenges in delivering bad news. Delivering the news to the family members of a terminally ill patient with COVID-19 that a virtual farewell may be their only chance to say goodbye to their loved one is another instance of novel challenges imposed by this pandemic. Several components of commonly used protocols such as the SPIKES model for delivering bad news may be very challenging to follow due to the remote nature of the conversation and the uncertainties surrounding this pandemic resulting in additional complexities in prognostication

Lack of sufficient training in breaking bad news is a handicap to most physicians and health care workers. Adherence to the principles of client-centered counseling is helpful in attaining this skill. Fundamental insight of the patient is exploited and the bad news is delivered in a structured manner, because the patient is the one who knows what is hurting him most and he is the one who knows how to move forward. 


Six-step SPIKES protocol is widely used for breaking bad news

This model was given by Baile WF, Buckman R, Lenzi R, Glober G, Beale EA, Kudelka AP (2000) SPIKES PROTOCOL. This acronym 'SPIKES" nevertheless helps memories the steps and consider their elements

rehabilitation at any stage after registration of the First Information Report and to be disbursed within 30 days of such order

Section 33(8) provides:

‚ÄúIn appropriate cases, the Special Court may, in addition to the punishment, direct payment of such
compensation as may be prescribed to the child for any physical or mental trauma caused to him or for immediate rehabilitation of such child.‚Äù

Rule 9 provides further details in relation to the payment of this compensation. It specifies
that the Special Court may order that the compensation be paid not only at the end of the
trial, but also on an interim basis, to meet the immediate needs of the child for relief or
rehabilitation at any stage after registration of the First Information Report. This
could include any immediate medical needs that the child may have. Further, Rule 9(3)
provides that the criteria to be taken into account while fixing the amount of compensation
to be paid include the severity of the mental or physical harm or injury suffered by the child;
the expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred on his/her medical treatment for physical
and/or mental health; and any disability suffered by the child as a result of the offence.
Hence, the child may recover the expenses incurred on his/her treatment in this way

(vii) whether the child became pregnant as a result of the offence;

(viii) whether the child contracted a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as a result of the offence;

(ix) whether the child contracted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a result of the offence;

(x) any disability suffered by the child as a result of the offence;

(xi) financial condition of the child against whom the offence has been committed so as to determine such child's need for rehabilitation;

(xii) any other factor that the Special Court may consider to be relevant.

(4) The compensation awarded by the Special Court is to be paid by the State Government from the Victims Compensation Fund or other scheme or fund established by it for the purposes of compensating and rehabilitating victims under section 357A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or any other law for the time being in force, or, where such fund or scheme does not exist, by the State Government.

(5) The State Government shall pay the compensation ordered by the Special Court within 30 days of receipt of such order.

(6) Nothing in these rules shall prevent a child or child's parent or guardian or any other person in whom the child has trust and confidence from submitting an application for seeking relief under any other rules or scheme of the Central Government or State Government.

Role of counselors in Child Sexual Abuse under POCSO Act 2012


The counsellor‚Äüs duties will include:

i) To understand the child's physical and emotional state

ii) To resolve trauma and foster healing and growth

iii) To hear the child's version of the circumstances leading to the concern

iv) To respond appropriately to the child when in crisis

v) To provide counselling, support, and group-based programs to children referred to them

vi) To improve and enhance the child‚Äüs overall personal and social development, and
his/her health and wellbeing

vii) To facilitate the reintegration of the child into his/her family/ community 

Counselling for children and families at risk is an integral component of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS). ICPS is a governmental program implemented by the Government Of India to help secure the safety of children, with a special emphasis on children in need of care and protection, juveniles in conflict or contact with the law and other vulnerable children. The ICPS
envisages the development of a cadre of counsellors to provide professional counselling
services under various components of the scheme. Counselling may be provided under ICPS
by any of the following:

i) CHILDLINE Service

ii) Counsellors appointed by the District Child Protection Society, who will report to the
Legal-cum-Probation Officer and will be responsible for providing counselling support
to all children and families coming in contact with the DCPS

iii) NGOs and other voluntary sector organisations- In all cases of penetrative sexual assault and all aggravated cases, arrangements should be made as far as possible to ensure that the child is provided counselling support. Where a counsellor is not available within the existing ICPS framework, the State Government may secure the engagement of external counsellors on contract basis. 

In order to enable the engagement of counsellors from outside the ICPS, including senior
counsellors for the more aggravated cases, the DCPU in each district shall maintain a list of
persons who may be appointed as counsellors to assist the child. These could include mental
health professionals employed by Government or private hospitals and institutions, as well as
NGOs and private practitioners outside the ICPS mechanism, chosen on the basis of
objective criteria.

As indicative criteria, for any counsellor engaged to provide services to a sexually abused
child, a graduate degree, preferably in Sociology/ Psychology (Child Psychology)/ Social
Work is a must. In addition to this, at least 2 to 3 years of work experience related to
providing counselling services to children in need of care and protection as well as their
parents and families and training on handling cases of child sexual abuse is essential in order
to ensure that the child receives counselling from those qualified for and experienced in
providing it. 

How to respond if the child discloses abuse

i) Believe him or her. The most important thing is to believe the child. Children rarely
lie about abuse; what is more common is a child denying that abuse happened when it
did. Tell the child you believe him/her.

ii) Don‚Äôt be emotionally overwhelmed and try to remain composed while talking to
the child.

iii) Do not interrogate the child. It can be traumatic for the child to repeat his/her story numerous times. Leave the questioning to the legal and police personnel.

iv) Reassure the child that the abuse is not their fault. The child's greatest fear is that
he or she is responsible for the abuse. Be sure to make it clear that what happened is
not a result of anything he/she did or did not do. This is particularly important when
the accused person is a member of the child‚Äüs family, such as his or her father, and the
child feels guilty at having put that person to trouble. 

v) Do not make promises you can‚Äôt keep. Do not make promises such as the child
will never have to see the abuser again, that nothing will change, or other such

vi) Believing and supporting the child are two of the best actions to start the healing process. Appropriate and helpful responses to disclosures are as follows:
a) ‚ÄúI am glad you told me, thank you for trusting me.‚Äù
b) ‚ÄúYou are very brave and did the right thing.‚Äù
c) ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äüt your fault.‚Äù

The counsellor should be aware that the effects of child sexual abuse are long-term and can
change the world view and the course of life of the child. The first step in the healing process is
for the child to talk about the abuse, and it is the counsellor‚Äüs duty to facilitate this; however, the
process of recovery may be long and the child will have other needs that the counsellor can
attend to such as collecting information, building rapport, supporting family members of the victim, arranging for other support services, sex education and normalizing the child's behavior.

Mandatory Reporting of Child Sexual Abuse Under POCSO Act 2012 [ Sec 19 of the POCSO Act 2012]

Section 19 of the POCSO Act, 2012 requires mandatory reporting of cases of child sexual
abuse to the law enforcement authorities, and applies to everyone including parents, doctors and
school personnel. Failure to report a suspicion of child abuse is an offence under the Act. The
legislation makes it clear that the reporting obligation exists whether the information was
acquired through the discharge of professional duties or within a confidential relationship. Any
private person who fails to report suspected child abuse, having acquired the information in the
discharge of his or her professional responsibilities, commits a summary conviction offence.


Similarly, school personnel, doctors and other professionals may, in the course of delivering
services, receive information which causes them to suspect that a child has been sexually abused.
It is possible that the information obtained includes the identity of the perpetrator. The alleged
perpetrator may be a person who is unknown to the reporter of the offence, but the suspicion
could also involve a colleague, co-worker, friend or other associate. The obligation to report is
unrestricted by any pre-condition that the complaint be first reported within the respective
departments, services or agencies, even if the perpetrator is alleged to be an employee of that
institution, service or agency. Thus, a person who has knowledge that an offence has been
committed under the child can directly report it to the police or magistrate

1. Why report?

The purpose of reporting is to identify children suspected to be victims of sexual abuse and to
prevent them from coming to further harm. Without detection, reporting and intervention, these
children may remain victims for the rest of their lives, carrying the scars of the abuse throughout
their lives and even, in some cases, repeating the pattern of abuse with their own children.
However, the nature of sexual abuse, the shame that eh child victim feels and the possible
involvement of a parent, family friend or other close person, makes it extremely difficult for
children to come forward to report sexual abuse. This is why the law provides for mandatory
reporting, placing the responsibility to report not on the child but on a surrounding adult who
may be in a better position to help. 

2. Obligation to inform the child

The Act does not lay down that a mandatory reporter has the obligation to inform the child and/
or his/her parents or guardian about his/her duty to report. However, it is good practice to let
them know that this will need to be done. For example, where a doctor is confronted with a situation where a child brought into his/her care is exhibiting symptoms of child sexual abuse, he should inform the child and/or his/her caregiver that he has a legal duty to report the abuse. This will help establish an open relationship and minimize the child‚Äüs feelings of betrayal if a report needs to be made. When possible, discuss the need to make a child abuse report with the family. However, be aware that there are certain situations where if the family is warned about the assessment process, the child may be at risk for further abuse, or the family may leave with the child.

3. What to Report?

Explain, as well as you can, what happened or is happening to the child. Describe the nature of
the abuse or neglect and the involved parties. Be as specific as possible. Be prepared to give the
name, address, and telephone number of the child and also the name of the parent or caretaker if
known. Even if you do not know all of this information, report what you do know. Tell all you
know about the situation.

However, the reporter is not expected to investigate the matter, know the legal definitions of
child abuse and neglect, or even know the name of the perpetrator. This should be left to the
police and other investigative agencies

4. Failure to Report Child Abuse

The POCSO Act, 2012 provides under Section 21(1) that any person, who fails to report the
commission of an offence or who fails to record such offence shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description which may extend to six months or with fine or with both.

School Mental Health Program 

Children and adolescence mark significant transitions in physiological, cognitive, emotional, moral, social, and other domains. Though most youngsters sail through these transitions, some become stressed, which may result in psychological problems. School mental health (SMH) programs have proven efficacy in enhancing psychological well-being of school-going children. The World Health Organization (WHO) also advocates School Mental Health Program to be an integral part of school health systems, having components of promotion of psychosocial competence, mental health education, and provision of services for those needing mental health interventions.

Good mental health is critical to children‚Äôs success in school and life. Research demonstrates that students who receive social emotional and mental and behavioral health support achieve better academically. School climate, classroom behavior, engagement in learning, and students‚Äô sense of connectedness and well-being all improve as well. Mental health is not simply the absence of mental illness but also encompasses wellness promotion; social, emotional, and behavioral health; and the ability to cope with life‚Äôs challenges. Left unmet, mental health problems are linked to costly negative outcomes such as academic and behavior problems, dropping out, and delinquency. Mental and behavioral health problems not only affect students‚Äô short-term classroom engagement, but also interfere with long-term development of positive relationships and work-related skills.

Schools provide an ideal context for prevention, intervention, positive development, and regular communication between school and families. Schools also offer caring relationships and regular, consistent connections between students and staff both in person and virtually. School-employed mental health professionals (i.e., school psychologists, school counselors, school social workers, and school nurses) know the students, parents, and other staff, which contributes to accessibility of services. Research shows that students are more likely to seek counseling when services are available in schools. In some cases, such as rural areas, schools provide the only mental health services in the community. Comprehensive, culturally responsive school mental health services can help address inequities in access and help reduce the stigma associated with receiving mental health services by making it part of the fabric of the school system

 Increased access to mental health services in schools is vital to improving the physical and psychological safety of our students and schools, as well as academic performance and problem-solving skills. Culturally responsive school mental health supports that encompass social‚Äìemotional learning, mental wellness, behavioral health, resilience, and positive connections between students and adults are essential to creating a school culture in which students feel safe and empowered to report safety concerns, which is proven to be among the most effective school safety strategies. Additionally, in the aftermath of a crisis, school-employed mental health professionals provide supports that facilitate a return to normalcy, are sustainable, and can help to identify and work with students with more intense or ongoing needs.

Role & Responsibilities of Healthcare Professionals under POCSO Act, 2012  

The Parliament of India passed the 'Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Bill (POCSO), 2011' regarding child sexual abuse on 22 May 2012 into an Act. In this video, I will be discussing the Responsibilities of Healthcare Professionals under POCSO Act, 2012 

The POCSO Act, 2012 also makes provisions for the medical examination of the child in a manner that is least distressful. The Act also clearly vocalizes that doctors should not demand FIR or legal procedure to be completed before initiating the treatment or examination. Legal procedures can be done later after initiating the medical care. 
RIGHT TO LIFE is prime and legal remedy will follow. Preserving the life should be given prime importance and collecting evidence should follow. 

It is now mandatory for doctors to register a medico-legal case in all cases of child sexual abuse. Failure of reporting could result in six months imprisonment and/or a fine under Section 21 of the POCSO Act, 2012. 

The registered medical practitioner rendering medical care shall (i) collect evidence after a thorough medical examination, (ii) treat the physical and genital injuries, (iii) conduct age assessment of the victim (if required), (iv) offer prophylaxis for sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, (v) discuss emergency contraceptives with the pubertal child and her parent, (vi) do baseline evaluation for mental health issues, (vii) monthly follow up at least for six months to look for development of psychiatric disorders, (viii) do family counselling and (ix) assist the court in interviewing the child and testifying in the court.

Another significant provision made in this law is that no hospital under the jurisdiction of the Indian constitution can refuse to admit the victim of child sexual abuse for examination and treatment. This issue has been re-emphasized in Section 23 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, which inserts Section 357C into the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. This Section provides that all hospitals are required to provide first-aid or medical treatment, free of cost, to the victims of a sexual offence. The amended Act, Section 166B of Indian Penal Code specifies that no hospital whether the private or public can deny treatment to a rape victim. Treatment should be provided immediately and free of cost. 

The POCSO Act, 2012 is a gender neutral legislation. It defines a child as any individual below 18 yr and provides protection to all children from sexual abuse. Definition of child sexual abuse is comprehensive and encompasses the following: (i) penetrative sexual assault, (ii) aggravated penetrative sexual assault, (iii) sexual assault, (iv) aggravated sexual assault, (v) sexual harassment, (vi) using child for pornographic purpose, and (vii) trafficking of children for sexual purposes. The above offences are treated as "aggravated", when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-Œ≥-vis the child. The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.

The POCSO Act further makes provisions for avoiding re-victimization, child friendly atmosphere through all stages of the judicial process and gives paramount importance to the principle of "best interest of the child". It incorporates child friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences, trial in-camera and without revealing the identity of the child through designated Special Courts. It also provides for the Special Court to determine the amount of compensation to be paid to a child who has been sexually abused, so that this money can then be used for the child's medical treatment and rehabilitation. 

A golden rule to all the medical professionals working with children is to report all reasonable degree of suspicion in child sexual abuse to the legal authorities. Hence, professionals need to keep watch on sexual abuse, explore and assess the child thoroughly. Though the POCSO Act, 2012 is an excellent piece of legislation and it recognizes almost every known form of sexual abuse against children as punishable offence, a few challenges remain to be answered. A multi-dimensional, multi-agency team and multi-tier approach including access to psychosocial support is to be made available to deliver holistic comprehensive care under one roof for victims of child sexual abuse.

- Mental and Physcial Health Impact of Child Sexual Abuse on Victims 

Sexual assault in childhood or adulthood impacts not only the victim, but also the victim‚Äôs family and friends as well as society as a whole. In this regard, sexual assault is a public health problem that concerns everyone.

Sexual assault has numerous potential consequences that can last a lifetime and span generations, with serious adverse effects on health, education, employment, crime, and the economic well-being of individuals, families, communities and societies

There does not appear to be a specific pattern of consequences from sexual abuse experienced in childhood. In fact, the sequelae, or after-effects, of childhood sexual abuse vary from one child to the next.

Victims of child sexual abuse can face immediate psychological consequences as well as chronic effects that can impact their adjustment throughout their development.


Immediate psychological consequences of child sexual abuse include: Shock, Fear, Anxiety, nervousness, Guilt, Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, Denial, Confusion, Withdrawal, isolation and Grief

Physical Health issues such as- 

i)Sexually transmitted diseases,

ii) Pregnancy,

iii) Complaints of pain or itching in the genital area,

iv) Difficulty in walking or sitting,

v) Repeated unusual injuries,

vi) Pain during elimination, and

vii) Frequent yeast infections


Sexual abuse in childhood is known to be a major risk factor in the development of long-term psychological and social adjustment problems that can carry over into adulthood and affect married life and parenthood.

The most common effects of sexual abuse in children are symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress and inappropriate sexual behaviour.

Roughly one third of sexually abused children do not display symptoms deemed problematic (i.e. symptoms that have reached the clinical threshold). There may be various reasons for this, including:

- These children experienced less severe sexual abuse.
- These children have protective factors that help them cope better with the trauma of the abuse.
- These children may exhibit no symptoms during assessment, but have latent sequelae that might manifest later.
- Depending on their age, victims of child sexual abuse are also at greater risk of experiencing symptoms of physical and mental health issues.

i) Abrupt changes in behaviour such as self harm, talks of suicide or attempt to suicide,
poor impulse control etc.

ii) Reluctance to go home.

iii) Sexualised behaviour or acting out sexually.

iv) Low self-esteem.

v) Wearing many layers of clothing regardless of the weather.

vi) Recurrent nightmares or disturbed sleep patterns and fear of the dark.

vii) Regression to more infantile behaviour like bed-wetting, thumb-sucking or excessive
crying.

viii)Poor peer relationships.

ix) Eating disturbances.

x) Negative coping skills, such as substance abuse and/or self-harm.

xi) An increase in irritability or temper tantrums.

xii) Fears of a particular person or object.

xiii)Aggression towards others.

xiv)Poor school performance.

xv) Knowing more about sexual behaviour than is expected of a child of that age



If childhood sexual abuse is not treated, long-term symptoms can go on through adulthood.
These may include:

i) PTSD and anxiety

ii) Depression and thoughts of suicide

iii) Sexual anxiety and disorders, including having too many or unsafe sexual partners

iv) Difficulty setting safe limits with others (e.g., saying no to people) and relationship
problems

v) Poor body image and low self-esteem

vi) Unhealthy behaviours, such as alcohol, drugs, self-harm, or eating problems. These
behaviours are often used to try to hide painful emotions related to the abuse

vii)Issues in maintaining relationships


The counsellor should be aware that the effects of child sexual abuse are long-term and can
change the world view and the course of life of the child. The first step in the healing process is
for the child to talk about the abuse, and it is the counsellor‚Äüs duty to facilitate this; however, the
process of recovery may be long and the child will have other needs that the counsellor can
attend to. This includes 

i) Rapport Building,
ii) working on the feelings of the child,
iii) Psychological Education on safe and unsafe touches, feelings, thoughts and behaviour,
safer coping techniques
iv) Helping the child to understand the abuse was not their fault;
v) Helping the child to develop of or regain their self-confidence;
vi) Provide sex education;
vii) Encourage appropriate social behaviour;
viii)Help the child to identify people who can form a supportive social environment around
him or her.

The counsellor is therefore a very important tool for the child in rebuilding his or her life after
he has been sexually abused.

Euthanasia | Mercy Killing | Physician assisted suicide | Right to die with dignity [Part 1]

The term Euthanasia comes from two Ancient Greek words: ‚ÄòEu‚Äô means ‚ÄòGood‚Äô, and ‚Äòthantos‚Äô means ‚Äòdeath‚Äô, so Euthanasia means good death. It is an act or practice of ending the life of an individual suffering from a terminal illness or in an incurable condition by injection or by suspending extra ordinary medical treatment in order to free him of intolerable pain or from terminal illness. Euthanasia is defined as an intentional killing by an act or omission of person whose life is felt is not to be worth living. It is also known as ‚ÄòMercy Killing‚Äô which is an act where the individual who, is in an irremediable condition or has no chances of survival as he is suffering from painful life, ends his life in a painless manner. It is a gentle, easy and painless death.

Euthanasia is a complex matter; there are many different types of euthanasia. Euthanasia may be classified according to consent and intervention 

1. Voluntary euthanasia- when the person who is killed has requested to be killed.

2. Non-voluntary euthanasia- when the person who is killed made no request and gave no consent. In other words, it is done when the person is unable to communicate his wishes, being in coma.

3. Involuntary euthanasia- when the person who is killed made an expressed wish to the contrary. In other words, it is involuntary when the person killed gives his consent not to die.

4. Active euthanasia- it is also known as ‚ÄòPositive Euthanasia‚Äô or ‚ÄòAggressive Euthanasia‚Äô. It refers to causing intentional death of a human being by direct intervention. It is a direct action performed to end useless life and a meaningless existence. For example by giving lethal dose of a drug or by giving a lethal injection. Active euthanasia is usually a quicker means of causing death and all forms of active euthanasia are illegal.

5. Passive euthanasia- it is also known as ‚ÄòNegative Euthanasia‚Äô or ‚ÄòNon-Aggressive Euthanasia‚Äô. It is intentionally causing death by not providing essential, necessary and ordinary care or food and water. It implies to discontinuing, withdrawing or removing artificial life support system. Passive euthanasia is usually slower and more uncomfortable than active. Most forms of voluntary, passive and some instance of non-voluntary, passive euthanasia are legal.

The Supreme Court has recognised the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right, major hurdles might be posed by religious communities, who mostly oppose euthanasia in India.
The issue of euthanasia rose to prominence in India after several noteworthy cases including that of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse who spent 42 years in a vegetative state as a result of a violent sexual assault. ‚ÄòPassive Euthanasia‚Äô was legalized by the Supreme Court on 7 March 2011. Also, based on the recommendations of the Law Commission, ministry of health and family welfare had prepared a draft of The Medical Treatment of Terminally Ill patients (protection of patients and medical practitioners) in May 2016.

In Common Cause (A Regd. Society) vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors, a leading case on euthanasia, passive euthanasia was legalized, and it was held, by the Supreme Court, that the ‚Äòright to die with dignity‚Äô is a fundamental right. Medical treatment can be refused, or decided against taking the same, by a sane adult human of conscious mind. He may decide to die a natural death, instead of availing the treatments.

The court has recognised ‚Äòpassive euthanasia‚Äô, in which the doctor does not cause the death of the person, he simply does not save him, by stopping the ongoing treatment, or by disabling the life-support machines, through the support of which, the patient is alive. ‚ÄòActive euthanasia‚Äô, which occurs as a result of administering and injecting a dose of lethal drug; of overdose of such a drug or medicine, which otherwise would not be lethal, but for the increase dosage, in the body of the victim, has been recognised in the Indian Courts, as of now.

The courts are of the view that a person, or here, a doctor cannot be punished for not saving a patient. However, since an ‚Äòact‚Äô not only includes a positive act on the part of the offender, but it also includes all the ‚Äòomissions‚Äô of the legal duty which one is bound to fulfill. Therefore, a person should be punished not only for some overt act, but also for the omission of a legal duty bound by law on him to fulfill.

While some countries in the world have already recognised and legalised the provision of euthanasia, the legalisation of the same may not be a very appealing idea. The courts in India, have, accordingly, taken a long time, from the cases of Gian Kaur, Aruna Shanbaug, to the case of Common cause (a regd. Society), in recognising and legalising the euthanasia, and have legalised passive, voluntary euthanasia. Active euthanasia has not been legalised yet, and hopefully will not be done in the future as well.

Mindfulness Practice | Mindfulness Therapy | Mindfulness Meditation 

Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention in the present moment without evaluation. Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one's attention to whatever is happening in the present moment. Becoming more aware of the present moment can help us enjoy the world around us more and understand ourselves better.

When we become more aware of the present moment, we begin to experience afresh things that we have been taking for granted.

Many of us spend large parts of our lives on auto pilot, not aware of what we are experiencing, missing out on all the sights and sounds and smells and connections and joys we could appreciate.  Some of that time our minds seem "switched off," and other times caught in thoughts from the past (often regrets) or plans for the future, much of which is repetitive.

When we do notice something in the present, our habit is often to judge instantly and react quickly, often working from a faulty or limited perspective that restricts our options or creates issues.

Mindfulness helps us be present in our lives and gives us some control over our reactions and repetitive thought patterns.  It  helps us pause, get a clearer picture of a situation, and respond more skillfully.

More specifically, research on mindfulness has identified these benefits:

Reduced rumination. Several studies have shown that mindfulness reduces rumination. In one study, for example, Chambers et al. (2008) asked 20 novice meditators to participate in a 10-day intensive mindfulness meditation retreat. After the retreat, the meditation group had significantly higher self-reported mindfulness and a decreased negative affect compared with a control group. They also experienced fewer depressive symptoms and less rumination. In addition, the meditators had significantly better working memory capacity and were better able to sustain attention during a performance task compared with the control group.

Stress reduction. Many studies show that practicing mindfulness reduces stress. In 2010, Hoffman et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 39 studies that explored the use of mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. The researchers concluded that mindfulness-based therapy may be useful in altering affective and cognitive processes that underlie multiple clinical issues.

Meditation has been studied in many clinical trials. The overall evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation for various conditions, including:

Stress
Anxiety
Pain
Depression
Insomnia
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Preliminary research indicates that meditation can also help people with asthma and fibromyalgia.

Meditation can help you experience thoughts and emotions with greater balance and acceptance. Meditation also has been shown to:

Improve attention
Decrease job burnout
Improve sleep
Improve diabetes control

Mindfulness has been shown to enhance self-insight, morality, intuition and fear modulation, all functions associated with the brain's middle prefrontal lobe area. Evidence also suggests that mindfulness meditation has numerous health benefits, including increased immune functioning (Davidson et al., 2003; see Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach, 2004 for a review of physical health benefits), improvement to well-being (Carmody & Baer, 2008) and reduction in psychological distress (Coffey & Hartman, 2008; Ostafin et al., 2006). In addition, mindfulness meditation practice appears to increase information processing speed (Moore & Malinowski, 2009), as well as decrease task effort and having thoughts that are unrelated to the task at hand (Lutz et al., 2009).

Pay attention. It's hard to slow down and notice things in a busy world. ...

- Live in the moment. 
- Try to intentionally bring an open, accepting and discerning attention to everything you do.
- Accept yourself. 
- Treat yourself the way you would treat a good friend.
- Focus on your breathing

Narcoanalysis, Brain Fingerprinting and Polygraph: Lie Detection Tests (Brain Mapping)   

The Lie Detection Tests / deception detection tests (DDT) such as polygraph, narco-analysis and brain-mapping have important clinical, scientific, ethical and legal implications . The Lie Detection Tests / DDTs are useful to know the concealed information related to crime. This information, which is known only to self, is sometimes crucial for criminal investigation. The Lie Detection Tests / DDTs have been used widely by the investigating agencies. However, investigating agencies know that the extracted information cannot be used as evidence during the trial stage. They have contested that it is safer than 'third degree methods' used by some investigators. Here, the claim is that, by using these so called, "scientific procedures" in fact-finding, it will directly help the investigating agencies to gather evidences, and thereby increase the rate of prosecution of the guilty and the rate of acquittal of the innocent . Recently, these methods are being promoted as more accurate and best to none, without convincing evidence. In a landmark judgment, the apex court of India has clearly stated that DDTs cannot be administered without consent 

The core debate arising out of the Lie Detection Tests is its legality of using inhuman degrading methods to confess the crime. The interrogation of the accused plays a vital role in collecting evidence. In a civilized world police torture is unacceptable to extract information about the crime. Even in the court of law, confession made to a police officer is not valid. Now, the question is, "Can police use DDT to extract information from the accused"? This viewpoint looks into the earlier court's view, recent Supreme Court judgment and scientific basis of DDTs.

Narco-analysis : This test involves the intravenous administration of a drug (such as sodium pentothal, scopolamine and sodium amytal) that causes the subject to enter into various stages of anaesthesia. In the hypnotic stage, the subject becomes less inhibited and is more likely to divulge information, which would usually not be revealed in the conscious state. He or she may also divulge all his/her fantasies, personal wishes, impulses, instinctual drive, illusions, delusions, conflicts, misinterpretations, etc. The main drawback of this technique is that some persons are able to retain their ability to deceive even in the hypnotic state, while others can become extremely suggestible to questioning. The drugs used do not guarantee that the subject will speak only the truth. The statements made in a hypnotic state are not voluntary and are also not in a clear state of mind; hence these have not been admitted as evidence in the court of law. Narco-analysis "without consent" raises legal issues 

Polygraph: This is also called a lie detector test, but this term is a misnomer. The theory behind polygraph tests is that a guilty subject is more likely to be concerned with lying about the relevant facts about the crime, which in turn produces a hyper-arousal state which is picked up by a person trained in reading polygraph results. It is not difficult to beat polygraph tests by a trained person, who is able to control or suppress his/her arousal symptoms through relaxation exercises, Yoga, meditation, etc. Hence, the reliability of the polygraph test has been repeatedly questioned in empirical studies.

Brain mapping: It measures the changes in the electrical field potentials produced by the sum of the neuronal activity in the brain by means of electrodes placed on the surface of the skin covering the head and face. The changes directly related to specific perceptual or cognitive events are called event-related potentials. In simple words, it is based on the finding that the brain generates a unique brain-wave pattern when a person encounters a familiar stimulus. Commonly used method in India is called as Brain Electrical Activation Profile test, also known as the 'P300 Waves test'. During the test, subjects are exposed to auditory or visual stimuli (pictures, videos and sounds) that are relevant to the facts being investigated alongside other irrelevant words and pictures. Such stimuli can be broadly classified as material 'probes' and neutral 'probes'. The underlying theory is that in the case of guilty suspects, the exposure to the material probes will lead to the emission of P300 wave components which will be duly recorded by the instruments. 

The Supreme Court judgment on involuntary Lie Detection Tests is that it has no place in the judicial process. Contemporary DDT needs to undergo rigorous research in normative and pathological populations. Premature application of these technologies outside research settings should be resisted. The vulnerability of the techniques to countermeasures also needs to be explored.

Concept of trauma in Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), once called shell shock or battle fatigue syndrome, is a serious condition that can develop after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic or terrifying event in which there was serious physical harm or threat. PTSD is a lasting consequence of traumatic ordeals that cause intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Examples of things that can bring on PTSD include sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, an accident, war, or natural disaster. Families of victims can develop PTSD, as can emergency personnel and rescue workers

Everyone reacts to traumatic events differently. Each person is unique in their ability to manage fear, stress and the threat posed by a traumatic event or situation. For that reason, not everyone who has a trauma will develop PTSD. Also, the type of help and support a person receives from friends, family members, and professionals following the trauma may impact the development of PTSD or the severity of symptoms.

PTSD was first brought to the attention of the medical community by war veterans; hence the names shell shock and battle fatigue syndrome. However, anyone who has had a traumatic event can develop PTSD. People who were abused as children or who have been repeatedly exposed to life-threatening situations are at risk for developing PTSD. Victims of trauma related to physical and sexual assault face the greatest risk for PTSD.

You may be more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event if you have a history of other mental health problems, have blood relatives with mental health problems, or have a history of alcohol or drug abuse.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) played an important role in defining trauma. Diagnostic criteria for traumatic stress disorders have been debated through several iterations of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) with a new category of Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders, across the life-span, included in the recently released DSM-V (APA, 2013). Measures and inventories of trauma exposure, with both clinical and research applications, have proliferated since the 1970‚Äôs.

With the advances in neuroscience, a biopsychosocial approach to traumatic experiences has begun to delineate the mechanisms in which neurobiology, psychological processes, and social attachment interact and contribute to mental and substance use disorders across the life-span.

Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual‚Äôs functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional,
or spiritual well-being

International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women

The International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women will mark the launch of the UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign (Nov 25- Dec 10) ‚Äî an initiative of 16 days of activism concluding on the day that commemorates the International Human Rights Day (10 December).

This campaign, led by the UN Secretary-General and UN Women since 2008, aims to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls around the world, calling for global action to increase awareness, promote advocacy and create opportunities for discussion on challenges and solutions.


Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is one of the most widespread, persistent and devastating human rights violations in our world today remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma and shame surrounding it.

In general terms, it manifests itself in physical, sexual and psychological forms, encompassing:

- intimate partner violence (battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide);

- sexual violence and harassment (rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances, child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber- harassment);

- human trafficking (slavery, sexual exploitation);

- female genital mutilation; and

- child marriage.


To further clarify, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women issued by the UN General Assembly in 1993, defines violence against women as ‚Äúany act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.‚Äù

The adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of VAWG affect women at all stages of their life. For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls; down the line they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market.

While gender-based violence can happen to anyone, anywhere, some women and girls are particularly vulnerable - for instance, young girls and older women, women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, migrants and refugees, indigenous women and ethnic minorities, or women and girls living with HIV and disabilities, and those living through humanitarian crises.

Neurobiology of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (Biological Basis of CBT) Brain changes noted in CBT 

Many mental health professionals held the unfortunate dichotomized position that psychotherapy is a treatment for ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù in nature, while medication is for ‚Äúbiological‚Äù in nature for psychiatric disorders. 

However, it has become clear that all mental processes drive from mechanisms of the brain. This means that any change in our psychologically processes is reflected by changes in the functions or structures of the brain

The advent of functional neuro-imaging, including photon emission CT (SPECT), positron emission topography, and functional MRI, has made it possible to study changes at the brain systems level (by measuring changes in the brain blood flow or metabolism) associated with cognitive behavior changes. This video will shed light on the biological basis of CBT reviewing the evidence from various studies such as functional neuroimaging, immunological studies, genetic studies and so forth. 

Any change in our psychologically processes is reflected by changes in the functions or structures of the brain, this clearly reveals that a ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù intervention can have a strong biological basis. For decades professionals believed that CBT resulted only in changing thought patterns but now, this is true, but the untold story is about the neurobiology (neuronal plasticity) of psychotherapy is becoming evident. 

Research are documenting that significant changes were noted pre- and post-CBT in blood flow to the brain clearly revealing that CBT is a potent biological intervention. 

A considerable heterogeneity exists with regard to study neuro-imaging study designs, selection of patients, duration of illness, adapted CBT type and intensity, and employed neuroimaging paradigms, all of which may partly explain the difference in studies‚Äô outcomes. The lack of randomization and effective controls in most of them makes it difficult to draw formal conclusion whether the observed effects are CBT mediated or due to spontaneous recovery. Despite the observed inconsistencies and dearth of data, CBT appears to exert its influences by bringing in neuronal plasticity in patients. This is completely changing how we view how talk therapies help individuals.

25 Tips for Cognitive Behavior Therapy Practitioners [25 Tips to CBT Therapists] 

Practicing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) seems pretty straightforward: you explain to the client how thoughts lead to feelings. You examine the client‚Äôs beliefs. You show them how they are distorting their thoughts, leading to negative feelings. You help the client change their thoughts. You ask them to implement a few behaviors. Easy, right? Even though CBT has a clear premise, conducting it is much more of an art than it is pure science. Here are twenty five tips to make sure your CBT treatment is a success. 

This video focuses on these 25 essential tips for practitioners from goal settings to termination of therapy. If the therapists are able to inculcate these skills/tips, they will be successful in their CBT practice.

CBT typically includes these steps:

Identify troubling situations or conditions in your life. These may include such issues as a medical condition, divorce, grief, anger or symptoms of a mental health disorder. You and your therapist may spend some time deciding what problems and goals you want to focus on.

Become aware of your thoughts, emotions and beliefs about these problems. Once you've identified the problems to work on, your therapist will encourage you to share your thoughts about them. This may include observing what you tell yourself about an experience (self-talk), your interpretation of the meaning of a situation, and your beliefs about yourself, other people and events. Your therapist may suggest that you keep a journal of your thoughts.

In guided discovery, the therapist will acquaint themselves with your viewpoint. Then they‚Äôll ask questions designed to challenge your beliefs and broaden your thinking. You might be asked to give evidence that supports your assumptions, as well as evidence that does not.
In the process, you‚Äôll learn to see things from other perspectives, especially ones that you may not have considered before. This can help you choose a more helpful path.

Identify negative or inaccurate thinking. To help you recognize patterns of thinking and behavior that may be contributing to your problem, your therapist may ask you to pay attention to your physical, emotional and behavioral responses in different situations.

Reshape negative or inaccurate thinking. Your therapist will likely encourage you to ask yourself whether your view of a situation is based on fact or on an inaccurate perception of what's going on. This step can be difficult. You may have long-standing ways of thinking about your life and yourself. With practice, helpful thinking and behavior patterns will become a habit and won't take as much effort.

Activity scheduling can help establish good habits and provide ample opportunity to put what you‚Äôve learned into practice.

Behavioral experiments are typically used for anxiety disorders that involve catastrophic thinking.

Before embarking on a task that normally makes you anxious, you‚Äôll be asked to predict what will happen. Later, you‚Äôll talk about whether the prediction came true.

Over time, you may start to see that the predicted catastrophe is actually not very likely to happen. You‚Äôll likely start with lower-anxiety tasks and build up from there.

CBT is a popular treatment that can be applied to a wide range of issues, including the management of bipolar disorder.

How to do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? | Practical aspects of CBT | Steps of CBT

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy (psychotherapy). You work with a mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

CBT can be a very helpful tool ‚Äï either alone or in combination with other therapies ‚Äï in treating mental health disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or an eating disorder. But not everyone who benefits from CBT has a mental health condition. CBT can be an effective tool to help anyone learn how to better manage stressful life situations.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to treat a wide range of issues. It's often the preferred type of psychotherapy because it can quickly help you identify and cope with specific challenges. It generally requires fewer sessions than other types of therapy and is done in a structured way. CBT is a useful tool to address emotional challenges.

You might decide on your own that you want to try cognitive behavioral therapy. Or a doctor or someone else may suggest therapy to you. Here's how to get started:

Find a therapist. You can get a referral from a doctor, health insurance plan, friend or other trusted source. Many employers offer counseling services or referrals through employee assistance programs (EAPs). Or you can find a therapist on your own ‚Äî for instance, through a local or state psychological association or by searching the internet.

Cognitive behavioral therapy may be done one-on-one or in groups with family members or with people who have similar issues. Online resources are available that may make participating in CBT possible, especially if you live in an area with few local mental health resources.

CBT often includes:

Learning about your mental health condition
Learning and practicing techniques such as relaxation, coping, resilience, stress management and assertiveness

Role of Socratic Questioning in Cognitive Behavior Therapy [ Socratic Questions]

The Socratic Method has been defined as a method of guided discovery in which the therapist asks a series of carefully sequenced questions to help define problems, assist in the identification of thoughts and beliefs, examine the meaning of events, or assess the ramifications of particular thoughts or behaviors.

The Socratic method, often described as the cornerstone of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Socratic questioning through a series of focused, open-ended questions that encourage reflection. It is widely used in teaching and counseling to expose and unravel deeply held values and beliefs that frame and support what we think and say.

By using a series of focused yet open questions, we can unpack our beliefs and those of others. Socratic questioning is critical to successful Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Indeed, in CBT, where the focus is on modifying thinking to facilitate emotional and behavioral change, the technique is recognized as helping clients define problems, identify the impact of their beliefs and thoughts, and examine the meaning of event

Building Block of CBT [Role of Thoughts, Emotions, Behavior and Sensations of CBT]

Building blocks of CBT are Thoughts, Emotions, Behavior and Sensations interacting with the environment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy (psychotherapy). You work with a mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.  The basic premise of CBT is that emotions are difficult to change directly, so CBT targets emotions by changing thoughts and behaviors that are contributing to the distressing emotions. CBT builds a set of skills that enables an individual to be aware of thoughts and emotions; identify how situations, thoughts, and behaviors influence emotions; and improve feelings by changing dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors. The process of CBT skill acquisition is collaborative.

CBT can be a very helpful tool ‚Äï either alone or in combination with other therapies ‚Äï in treating mental health disorders, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or an eating disorder.

Cognitive Schemas [Role of Cognitive Schemas in Cognitive Behavior Therapy] 

A schema is a cognitive structure that serves as a framework for one‚Äôs knowledge about people, places, objects, and events. A schema is a preconceived idea that we use to interpret the new information. Schemas help people organize their knowledge of the world and understand new information. While these mental shortcuts are useful in helping us make sense of the large amount of information we encounter on a daily basis, they can also narrow our thinking and result in stereotypes.

Schemas are the building blocks of knowledge, which is explained by Piaget‚Äôs (1936) theory of cognitive development. He explains how a child constructs a mental model of the world.  Piaget defined a schema as: ‚Äúa cohesive, repeatable action sequence possessing component actions that are tightly interconnected and governed by a core meaning.‚Äù

A schema is a mental representation that enables us to organize our knowledge into categories.
Our schemas help us simplify our interactions with the world. They are mental shortcuts that can both help us and hurt us.

We use our schemas to learn and think more quickly. However, some of our schemas may also be stereotypes that cause us to misinterpret or incorrectly recall information.

Foundations of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (Theoretical aspects of CBT) Principles of CBT 

CBT theory suggests that our thoughts, emotions, body sensations, and behavior are all connected, and that what we think and do affects the way we feel. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps people identify and change thinking and behavior patterns that are harmful or ineffective, replacing them with more accurate thoughts and functional behaviors, It can help a person focus on current problems and how to solve them. It often involves practicing new skills in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. This video delineates the core principles of CBT, theory and building blocks of CBT. CBT aims to change how a person thinks (‚Äòcognitive‚Äô) and what they do (‚Äòbehaviour‚Äô). CBT therefore uses both cognitive and behavioural techniques. 

CBT is fundamentally about the meanings which people make of their experiences. CBT is often misrepresented as being concerned with ‚Äòfixing‚Äô faulty thought processes, being ‚Äòrational‚Äô, or only working with ‚Äòsurface‚Äô issues: but all of these are mischaracterizations. As we live our lives we interpret what is going on around us: we form beliefs and understandings. These meanings affect how we actually perceive the world. Sometimes our beliefs are distressing to us and can lead to unhelpful ways of acting. The role of a CBT therapist is to help their clients to understand and examine their beliefs: to help them to make sense of meanings

The insight of the CBT model is that it is not events that bother us. Instead, it is the way that we interpret events ‚Äì the meaning that we give to them ‚Äì that gives rise to our feelings. This explains why two people experiencing the same event can react in completely different ways.

Another important part of cognitive behavioral theory is that our thoughts, feelings, body sensations, and behavior are all inter-related and can affect one another. Things that we do (or things that happen to us) can affect what we think, which can in turn affect how we feel. If you have ever felt poorly with an illness, then you might have had the experience where your body feelings and emotions made you see the world in a ‚Äòbleaker‚Äô or more ‚Äòcatastrophic‚Äô light. CBT therapists have lots of ways of representing the relationships between our attention, perception, thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

The level closest to the surface are automatic thoughts. These are thoughts or images which involuntarily ‚Äòpop‚Äô into our minds. They often appear in response to a trigger which can be an event, feeling, or another thought or memory. Automatic thoughts can be accurate (in which case CBT therapists would tend to leave them alone), or they can be biased (in which case they may merit further discussion).

The deepest level of cognitions are our core beliefs. These are often unspoken and may never have been verbalized. We often hold core beliefs as ‚Äòtruths‚Äô about ourselves, the world, or other people, but it is important to remember that they are opinions and not facts. We are not born with them, but rather they are the product of our life experiences. They can be thought of as our implicit answers to the question ‚ÄúWhat has life taught you [about yourself, other people, or the world]?‚Äù. Core beliefs often take the form of ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô statements.

The middle level of cognitions are intermediate beliefs, which often take the form of rules and assumptions. These can often be phrased in the form of ‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ then‚Äù statements or contain the tell-tale words ‚Äòshould‚Äô or ‚Äòmust‚Äô. We may hold on to our rules or assumptions as ways of preventing the worst consequences of our core beliefs from coming true.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a pragmatic, action-oriented treatment approach that has become a widely used psychotherapy for major mental disorders. CBT methods were initially developed for depression and anxiety disorders and later they were modified for many other conditions, including personality disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse

CBT is a powerful and flexible form of psychological therapy. There is a great deal of evidence that it is a helpful approach for a wide variety of problems including anxiety, depression, pain, and trauma. We know that it works when delivered face-to-face and can be effective as self-help.

Description of video 289:
Automatic Negative Thoughts [ Role of Automatic Negative Thoughts in Cognitive Behavior Therapy] 

Automatic thoughts are ones that pop into our heads in response to a trigger or an event or stress. Automatic negative thoughts are the kind of negative self-talk that appears immediately, without us even being aware of forming a thought, in response to a certain stimulus. They're often irrational and negative for our mental well-being. Each person‚Äôs automatic thoughts may be different from the next person's. They're usually related to our life experiences. Plus, our fears or the messages we've internalized for years. 

Our emotions, both pleasant and unpleasant, are the result of our thoughts. Automatic negative thoughts induces negative emotions. These negative emotions appear as a reaction to the  negative self-talk that appears immediately, without us even being aware of forming a thought, in response to a certain stimulus. Everyone experiences negative emotions. We can't, and shouldn't, avoid them. But, we don't need our automatic thoughts adding more negative burdens. If we aren't aware, they create negative feelings that can affect how we behave and become self-fulfilling. They can make us feel like we‚Äôve lost control of our own thoughts. They fill us with anxiety, guilt, and other negative emotions.

Cognitive Distortions [Role of Cognitive Distortions in Cognitive Behavior Therapy] Cognitive Errors


Aaron T Beck, American Psychiatrist developed a cognitive hypothesis of development of psychopathology in humans. He pioneered in the area of cognitive triad, distortions, schemas and automatic negative thoughts. 

Cognitive distortions (Cognitive errors) are negatively biased errors in thinking that are purported to increase vulnerability to depression or mental illness. Cognitive distortions are error in logical thinking.  

If the thought distortions are reinforced often enough due to our habitual thinking, it can lead to an increase in anxiety, depression, and unhealthy relationships.

It is important to recognize that all cognitive distortions are:

a)Habitual patterns of thinking or beliefs

b) False, inaccurate, and often exaggerated thoughts

c) Manifest itself as negative emotions or feelings

d) May increase anxiety and depression, potentially causing psychological damage

Cognitive distortions (Cognitive errors) are negatively biased errors in thinking that are purported to increase vulnerability to depression or mental illness. These cognitive error patterns or habits make us exaggerate or inaccurately perceive reality in an unhealthy way. This can be damaging to our mental health, relationships, and wellbeing.


Cognitive distortions are 

a) mindreading (i.e., assuming that others are thinking negatively about oneself), 

b) catastrophizing (i.e., making negative predictions about the future based on little or no evidence), 

c) all-or-nothing-thinking (i.e., viewing something as either-or, without considering the full spectrum and range of possible evaluations), 

d) emotional reasoning (i.e., believing something to be true based on emotional responses rather than objective evidence), 

e) labeling (i.e., classifying oneself negatively after the occurrence of an adverse event), 
f) mental filtering (i.e., focusing on negative information and devaluing positive information), 

g) overgeneralization (i.e., assuming that the occurrence of one negative event means that additional bad things will happen), 

h) personalization (i.e., assuming that one is the cause of a negative event), 

i) should statements (i.e., thinking that things must or should be a certain way), and 

j) minimizing or disqualifying the positive (i.e., ignoring or dismissing positive things that have happened).

Cognitive Triad [Role of Cognitive Behavior Therapy] Aaron Beck's Triad  [ Negative Triad]

Aaron T Beck, American Psychiatrist developed a system called the cognitive triad of negative thoughts to explain how a person's thought life could create a depressive mindset. This mindset would then eventually lead to clinical depression if practiced enough. Beck devised the triad because he said that people who are depressed have unrealistic thoughts regarding themselves. Every person has thoughts about their future, themselves and the events they experience. Depressed people, according to Aaron Beck, carry false negative beliefs. The triad consists of negative thoughts which take the form of:

1. Self: 'I am a bad person'
2. Experiences: 'My life is terrible'
3. Future: 'My life will never get better'

These may seem like extremes, but Beck's theory suggests that these are generally the cause of an individual's depression. He also says that the severity and length of time repeating these thoughts directly correlates to how severe an individual's depression will be. Basically, the more a person has these types of thoughts, will express how deep their depression is.

Forensic Interviewing of the Child Victims or Survivors | Forensic Examination of Child Witness


Forensic Interviewing of the child under POCSO Act 2012 [Examination of the child witness in Child Sexual Abuse]

Forensic interviewing is a means of gathering information from a victim or witness for use in a legal setting, such as a court hearing. The purpose of these interviews is to gather factual information in a legally defensible and developmentally appropriate manner about whether a child (or other person) has been abused. Forensic interviews are conducted by trained professionals, such as psychiatrist, nurse, pediatrician, advocate and psychologist.

Forensic interviews are used by trained professionals to gather information about incidents of alleged child abuse in a manner that will yield factual information from the child and stand up to scrutiny in court. For example, forensic interviewing techniques are designed to remove or minimize the potential for the interviewer to use suggestive or leading questions that may call the child‚Äôs statements into question. Forensic interviews can also help shape the investigation by highlighting areas for further investigation or evidence collection. 

All forensic interview tend to have the following phases in common 

Rapport-building phase: The interviewer attempts to build a trusting relationship with the child and explains some of the details about the interview process (e.g., documentation, instructions). This phase also allows the interviewer to better understand the child‚Äôs developmental level, linguistic capabilities, legal competency, and other characteristics and may provide the child with opportunities to practice providing narrative information.

Substantive phase: The interviewer seeks information related to the alleged abuse. This may include obtaining a narrative description of the event, inquiring about additional details, and testing alternative or multiple hypotheses (e.g., other possible scenarios), if appropriate.

Closure phase: The interviewer may address the child‚Äôs socioemotional or other immediate needs, transition to a topic not related to the alleged incident, or answer any questions.

Models may be scripted (i.e., interviewers are provided what to say verbatim), semistructured (i.e., interviewers are given guidance but are able to make certain decisions about how to proceed), or flexible (i.e., the interviewer is given great leeway so he or she can better follow the lead of the child) 

Common topics covered by the instructions include requesting that the child only provide information about things that actually happened, giving the child permission to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù advising the child to ask the interviewer to clarify a question if the child does not understand, and informing the child to alert the interviewer if the interviewer provides incorrect information.

The interview, where appropriate. The interviewer also may provide the child with opportunities to practice following the instructions (e.g., asking the child a question to which he or she would not know the answer in order to see if he or she will respond with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù). 

During the rapport-building phase, some interviewer ask the child to promise to tell the truth. Analogue research shows that children tend to be more likely to tell the truth if they promised to do so prior to being interviewed about the event in question, but the evidence is not as strong. 

The purpose of all forensic interviewing models is to discourage the use of leading questions or techniques, but they may vary to some degree about which are the most preferred types of questions. There is consensus that open-ended questions (i.e., a question that invites a detailed, multiword response, such as ‚ÄúTell me what happened.‚Äù) 

Anatomical dolls and drawings rely on recognition memory (i.e., the child chooses a response from a series of alternatives), which may be less accurate but more detailed. The cue of the anatomical doll or diagram could trigger the child‚Äôs recognition of other body-related experiences 

If more than one interview is needed, the same interviewer should interview the child. Interviewers should ensure they adhere to good forensic interviewing practice to help limit any negative consequences of conducting multiple interviews, such as the child experiencing additional trauma when providing multiple accounts of the maltreatment 

Forensic interviewing is an extremely valuable tool for the investigation of child abuse allegations. When properly executed, it can assist in gathering factual information about the allegations using legally defensible techniques. A good forensic interview also can lead to the child and family receiving services and supports that best meet their needs

National Mental Health Policy of India 2014

The policy aims to enhance awareness and understanding about mental health and strengthening leadership in the mental health sector at all levels. It will have a pro-poor orientation because only the creamy layer of society presently has access to mental healthcare in India, the minister said.

Vision

The vision of the National Mental Health Policy is to promote mental health, prevent mental illness, enable recovery from mental illness, promote destigmatization and desegregation, and ensure socio-economic inclusion of persons affected by mental illness by providing accessible, affordable and quality health and social care to all persons through their life-span within a rights-based frame work.

Goals of the policy

To reduce distress, disability, exclusion morbidity and premature mortality associated with mental health problems across life span of the person.

To enhance understanding of the mental health in the country.

To strengthen the leadership in the mental health sector at the national, state and district levels.

Objectives of the Policy

To provide universal access to mental health care.

To increase access to and utilisation of comprehensive mental health services by persons with mental health problems.

To increase access to mental health care especially to vulnerable groups including homeless persons, persons in remote areas, educationally, socially and deprived sections.

To reduce prevalence and impact of risk factors associated with mental health problems.

To reduce risk and incidence of suicide and attempted suicide.

To ensure respect for rights and protection from harm of persons with mental health problems.

To reduce stigma associated with mental health problems.

To enhance availability and equitable distribution of skilled human resources for mental health.

To progressively enhance financial allocation and improve utilisation for mental health promotion and care.

To identify and address the social, biological and psychological determinants of mental health problems and to provide appropriate interventions.

Higher investment in mental health care is justifiable because the economic benefits of effective, equitable, and accessible care far outweigh cost of disability and loss of livelihood due to mental illness.

Finally, the policy acknowledges a wide range of mental health goals from promotion of mental health to long-term needs of persons with enduring mental health problems.

The Act defines a child as any person below 18 years of age and defines different forms of sexual abuse including penetrative and non-penetrative assault as well as sexual harassment and pornography. 

The POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive law to provide for the protection of children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography while safeguarding the interests of the child at every stage of the judicial process by incorporating child-friendly mechanisms for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and speedy trial of offences through designated special courts.

It deems a sexual assault to be ‚Äúaggravated‚Äù under certain circumstances such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-√†-vis the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor. People who traffic children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the Act.

Salient features of the Act and its amendment

The Act is gender neutral and regards the best interests and welfare of the child as a matter of paramount importance at every stage so as to ensure the healthy physical, emotional, intellectual and social development of the child.

It defines different forms of sexual abuse, including penetrative and non-penetrative assault, as well as sexual harassment and pornography, and deems a sexual assault to be ‚Äúaggravated‚Äù under certain circumstances, such as when the abused child is mentally ill or when the abuse is committed by a person in a position of trust or authority vis-√†-vis the child, like a family member, police officer, teacher, or doctor.

People who traffic children for sexual purposes are also punishable under the provisions relating to abetment in the Act. The Act prescribes stringent punishment graded as per the gravity of the offence, with a maximum term of rigorous imprisonment for life, and fine.

It defines "child pornography" as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a child which include photograph, video, digital or computer generated image indistinguishable from an actual child, and image created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict a child;'

The Act recognizes that the Intent to commit an offence, even when unsuccessful for whatever reason, needs to be penalized.

The attempt to commit an offence under the Act has been made liable for punishment for upto half the punishment prescribed for the commission of the offence.

The Act also provides for punishment for abetment of the offence, which is the same as for the commission of the offence.

The Act makes it mandatory to report commission of an offence and also the recording of complaint and failure to do so would make a person liable for punishment of imprisonment for six months or / and with fine. 

The media has been barred from disclosing the identity of the child without the permission of the Special Court. The punishment for breaching this provision by media may be from six months to one year (Section 23).

For speedy trial, the Act provides for the evidence of the child to be recorded within a period of 30 days. Also, the Special Court is to complete the trial within a period of one year, as far as possible (Section 35).

To provide for relief and rehabilitation of the child, as soon as the complaint is made to the Special Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) or local police, these will make immediate arrangements to give the child, care and protection such as admitting the child into shelter home or to the nearest hospital within twenty-four hours of the report. 

The SJPU or the local police are also required to report the matter to the Child Welfare Committee within 24 hours of recording the complaint, for long term rehabilitation of the child.

Violence against children has increased exponentially, requiring greater intervention to meet the challenges. It violates the rights and the dignity of the child and robs from them the joys of childhood.

A golden rule to all the medical professionals working with children is to report all reasonable degree of suspicion in child sexual abuse to the legal authorities. Hence, professionals need to keep watch on sexual abuse, explore and assess the child thoroughly. Though the POCSO Act, 2012 is an excellent piece of legislation and it recognizes almost every known form of sexual abuse against children as punishable offence, a few challenges remain to be answered. A multi-dimensional, multi-agency team and multi-tier approach including access to psychosocial support is to be made available to deliver holistic comprehensive care under one roof for victims of child sexual abuse

Homeless persons with mental illness (HPMI) suffer indignities due to shirking of all obligations by society. In addition, the HPMI is denied all rights available to citizens, such as confidentiality, privacy, safety, right to practice religion, health, and the right to not suffer from inhuman treatment. In this context, the new Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA), 2017 has brought in a list of rights for HPMI, and this is a welcome sign. The MHCA has also taken away the mandated involvement of the judiciary to provide care for the HPMI. 

Every officer in charge of a police station shall have a duty to take under protection any person found wandering at large within the limits of the police station whom the officer has reason to believe has a mental illness and is incapable of taking care of himself. The police shall take the PWMI to the
nearest public health establishment as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four hours from the time of being taken into protection, for assessment of the person‚Äôs healthcare needs. 

This is a welcome move and simplifies the process of providing care for the HPMI by preventing untoward delays. However, on the other hand, ground realities in terms of the systems and the existent infrastructure are far from satisfactory. Further work needs to involve all stakeholders to realize the true spirit of the Act. Apart from the speedy and strict implementation of its provisions, public-private partnerships are another way forward. There is an urgent need to invest in community facilities such as halfway homes, daycare centers, home again facilities, and clustered group homes

Law, Mental Illness, Marriage and Divorce 

Mental illness of a person itself is not a ground for divorce; according to law, if a person has mental disorder of a kind that the spouse cannot be reasonably be expected to live with them, then divorce may be granted.

The mental disorder has to be of such extent that the partner cannot live with him/her. There are stages of severity and the court needs to decide, depending on the case in hand. The problem is that many of them working in the court are often not sensitized or sufficiently aware of mental health issues or severity or treatment related matters. However, the Apex court judgements revolve around whether the person with mental illness is capable of leading a married life

Divorces based on the mere presence of mental disorder is not the norm but the mental illness should be so severe to the extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent have been the clear stand of the Apex court's case laws in India 

Psychiatrists may be called in to provide opinion regarding the presences of mental illness and severity of mental illness. However, determining unsoundness of mind can be a difficult issue, especially when made in retrospect.  

In India arranged marriage is the norm. The concealment of prior history of mental illness from the prospective party and offer of handsome dowry facilitate the solemnization of marriage in the background of arranged marriage. After marriage when mental illness is discovered in the women, rejection is common. Various marriage laws - personal laws (such as e.g., Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, etc.,) have put some restrictions on marriage of persons with mental illness, making the marriage voidable if illness is severe and chronic and disabling. 

Issue becomes more complex, when mental cruelty dimension is added. The Supreme Court had examined the concept of legal cruelty in Dastane v Dastane (1975). In that case, the court held that the wife threatening she would end her life, and verbally abusing the husband and his father, among other acts, amounted to mental cruelty, and granted divorce to the husband. The courts have also given similar relief in other cases, including those of persistent drunkenness and repeatedly making unfounded allegations. If one spouse establishes extramarital affair with another lady/man, it is considered as an act damaging the foundation of the marriage and divorce is granted. And if one of the spouses makes such allegations and he/she fails to prove it, it is considered as an act causing mental pain to other spouse and considered as an instance of cruelty.

The relation between marriage and mental illness is indeed a very complex and multi-faceted one. Besides each influencing the outcome of the other, the matter also has legal, social, economical and moral dimensions associated with it.

Negligence is the breach of a legal duty to care. A breach of this duty gives a patient the right to initiate action against negligence.  Doctors in India may be held liable for their services individually or vicariously. Doctors must exercise an ordinary degree of skill. However, they cannot give a warranty of the perfection of their skill or a guarantee of cure. If the doctor has adopted the right course of treatment, if she/ he is skilled and has worked with a method and manner best suited to the patient, she/ he cannot be blamed for negligence if the patient is not totally cured.

The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is important legislation that is indicative of a progressive nation. This is clearly indicated in the clause of Advance Directive under Mental Healthcare Act, 2017  

The enactment of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 by the current government is an attempt to protect the rights of the mentally ill and enable citizens to decide on the method of treatment in case of mental illness, lest they are mistreated or neglected. India ratified the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities in October 2007. The government to make appropriate changes by amending the mental health legislation of the country. Hence, a new Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 was drafted and notified to uphold the rights of the persons with mental illness   

The Act proposes an ‚Äòadvance medical directive‚Äô through which individuals can dictate how they ‚Äúwish to be" and ‚Äúwish not to be treated" and can nominate a member who can make decisions on their behalf should they lose their mental capacity. But it is unable to provide a clear procedure for preparing it. Advance directives empower a mentally ill person to have the right to make an advance directive of how they would want to be treated for their requisite illness and who should be their nominated representative. This directive has to be vetted by a medical practitioner

Insanity Defense (not guilty by reason of insanity) not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.

To read the article - Insanity Defense: Past, Present, and Future - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4676201/ 

Click above  

Insanity defense is primarily used in criminal prosecutions. It is based on the assumption that at the time of the crime, the defendant was suffering from severe mental illness and therefore, was incapable of appreciating the nature of the crime and differentiating right from wrong behavior, hence making them not legally accountable for crime. Insanity defense is a legal concept, not a clinical one.

This means that just suffering from a mental disorder is not sufficient to prove insanity. The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a ‚Äúpreponderance of the evidence‚Äù which is similar to a civil case. It is hard to determine legal insanity, and even harder to successfully defend it in court.

Insanity defense has been in existence since many centuries; however, it took a legal position only since the last three centuries. There were various tests used to declare a person legally insane such as Wild Beast test, The Insane Delusion test, and ‚Äútest of capacity to distinguish between right and wrong.‚Äù These three tests laid the foundation for the landmark Mc Naughten rule. 

In 1843, Daniel Mc Naughten, a wood-turner from Glasgow, shot and killed Edward Drummond mistaking him for Sir Robert Peel. Mc Naughten believed that he was persecuted by the Tories, and evidence was brought to show that he had been totally deluded on this subject for some time.[11,12] His state of mind was apparent from the outset when he had to be coaxed, and finally tricked, into pleading ‚Äúnot guilty.‚Äù After hearing seven medical witnesses testify that he was completely insane, the judge stopped the trial, the jury brought in the special verdict without summing up and without retiring, and Mc Naughten was forcibly committed to the Bethlem Hospital.

Section 84 of IPC deals with the ‚Äúact of a person of unsound mind. ‚ÄúNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.‚Äù

Psychiatrists may be asked to assist the court in determining whether certain mental disorders affected a person's ability to form the intent necessary to make that person legally culpable. The medical discipline describes the patient's mental status on a continuum that ranges from extremely ill to completely healthy. However, the legal language is clearly categorical in nature, either criminally responsible or not responsible. While a psychiatrist is concerned with medical treatment of individual patients, courts are concerned with the protection of the society from the possible dangerousness from these patients. Psychiatrist needs to understand that it is not only the fact that the person is suffering from mental illness but it is the totality of the circumstances seen in the light of the evidence on record to prove that the person was also unable to appreciate the nature of the act or wrongdoing or that it was contrary to the law is appreciated in the court of law for insanity defense

Right to Access for Mental Healthcare, Under Mental Healthcare Act of 2017

Section 18 of the Act articulates that ‚Äúevery person shall‚Äù have a right to access mental health care and treatment from mental health services run or funded by the appropriate government, and the government shall make sufficient provision as may be necessary, for a range of services required by PMI. If the government fails to provide the right to access mental health care to everyone, then it is the responsibility of the government to reimburse the costs of treatment according to section 18, 5 (f) of the MHCA 2017. Section 18 is for ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù because a person who is on prophylaxis (on follow-up and do not meet the criteria of PMI) can access mental health-care services and free essential medicines; a person who does not meet the criteria of PMI (had an illness but improved currently) can access a range of rehabilitation services, and another person can seek help before he/she develops mental illness (prevention and promotion). It is very important to note that only Section 18 of the MHCA, 2017 says every person has the right to access mental health care and beyond doubt, it applies to everyone. However, Section 19‚Äì28 applies only for PMI.

Justiciability of right to access to mental health care

The Act has taken a paradigm shift of providing ‚Äúmental healthcare‚Äù as a ‚Äújusticiable rights.‚Äù Justiciability refers to the amenability of an issue to be adjudicated on in the judicial or quasi-judicial statutory bodies under the legislation. This right is meant to ensure that services be accessible, affordable, and of good quality. It also mandates the provision of mental health services to be established and available in every district of the country. Now, all States are legally bound to provide this right to their citizens under the MHCA, 2017. This is a landmark legislation in terms of making the government accountable for a socioeconomic right ‚Äì the ‚Äúright to access mental health care.‚Äù

Treatment Resistant OCD (Treatment Refractory OCD) Approach and Management. rTMS, DBS, Gamma knife & Psychosurgery for OCD

Despite advancements in pharmacotherapeutic and behavioral interventions, a substantial proportion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) continue to have disabling and treatment-refractory illness. This video focuses on novel promising research treatment tried across the world such as rTMS, DBS, Gamma Knife and neurosurgical approach. 

Evidence-based guidelines recommend selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or behavior therapy as first-line treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, around 40%‚Äì60% do not respond adequately to either treatment. Around 30% of such patients respond to augmentation with antipsychotics. It has been estimated that around 10%‚Äì20% of OCD patients are refractory to all available pharmacological and psychological treatments. Many of these patients have chronic, severe, and disabling symptoms causing significant social and economic burden. Neurosurgical treatments have a role in this population, that is, patients with chronic and severe OCD, who are refractory to available noninvasive treatment strategies.

The advent of stereotactic surgical techniques and advances in neuroimaging in the last few decades have greatly enhanced the specificity and accuracy of targeting in brain surgeries. This is in stark contrast to the earlier procedures such as prefrontal leukotomy and lobotomy, for which the term ‚Äúpsychosurgery‚Äù has unfortunately become synonymous with. Contemporary neurosurgical procedures involve either creation of small lesions in the order of millimeters (ablative surgery) or implantation of electrodes in very specific subcortical regions for neuromodulation (deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Refinements of targets based on the experience and understanding of neurobiology have improved the safety and efficacy of these procedures

Neurosurgical interventions, including ablative procedures and deep brain stimulation (DBS), have emerged as potential treatment options in this population. Given the invasiveness and limited evidence, these procedures have been performed in carefully selected patients with severe, chronic, and treatment-refractory illness. Along with informed consent, an independent review by a multidisciplinary team is mandated in many centers. Both ablative procedures and DBS have been found to be helpful in around half the patients, with improvement observed months after the procedure. Various targets have been proposed for either procedure, based on the dominant corticostriatal model of OCD. There is no strong evidence to recommend one procedure over the other. Hence, the choice of procedure is often based on the factors such as affordability, expertise, and reversibility of adverse effects. Surgery is not recommended as a standalone treatment but should be provided as part of a comprehensive package including medications and psychotherapeutic interventions. Available evidence suggest that the benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks in a treatment-refractory population. Advances in neurosurgical techniques and increasing knowledge of neurobiology are likely to bring about further progress in the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the procedures.

This video will focus on the current status of treatment resistant/refractory OCD, neurosurgical treatment for OCD, providing an overview on clinical aspects including patient selection, consent/review process, a brief description of contemporary surgical procedures, and postoperative follow-up.

World Alzheimer's Day 2022

World Alzheimer's Day is observed on 21st September every year to raise the awareness about Alzheimer's and Dementia. This day is observed for generating awareness, decreasing stigma, sensitizing policy makers and to invest in providing care for persons with Alzheimer's Dementia.

In India 5 million people are suffering from Dementia. It not only affects the individual, but also burdens the whole family.  Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is often called a family disease because of the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline affects everyone. 

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. It is a progressive brain disease which results in loss of memory and thinking skills. It destroys the brain cells which cause memory loss, memory changes, erratic behaviour and loss of body functions. This disease usually starts slowly but gets worse with time. One of the most common early symptoms of Alzheimer is difficulty in remembering the recent events. Alzheimer's patient forgets the name of the people like longtime friend, address, even name of the roads and other things.

Important Points 

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disease. It starts with forgetting things and develops short memory loss which results in difficulty in remembering recent events, eventually resulting in the inability to look after daily activities and even basic needs.

Alzheimer's disease mostly affects elderly people. Since the population of elderly people is rising in India, this is the cause of alarm.

The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet known. Certain complex events occurring in the brain appear to cause this disease.

There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Early detection benefits the patient in treating this disease effectively.

The treatment modalities include medicinal, psychological and care giving aspects.

Family and social support plays a key role. 

With the increases in life spans and baby boomers coming of age, support for Alzheimer‚Äôs research is more critical to our families than ever. 

Since its inception, the impact of World Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia is increasing. However, the stigmatisation and lack of information surrounding dementia remains to be a global problem that calls for global action. Most people often think that this disease is a normal part of ageing. Alzheimer‚Äôs is a progressive disease that impairs memory and other mental functions. It is the most common form of dementia that generalizes memory loss and loss of other essential cognitive abilities that are serious enough to interfere with an individual‚Äôs daily life.

Detailed Assessment of Substance Use Disorders (Alcohol and Drugs Use )

Substance use disorders are diseases that affect a person‚Äôs brain and behavior. Prolonged substance use can lead to dependence and cravings, meaning that the body becomes dependent on a specific substance to function. The way that addiction occurs is that substances activate the brain‚Äôs reward systems, which produce feelings of pleasure, relaxation, and euphoria. The rewards felt from taking abusing substances are so great that people will continue to use despite negative consequences. 

While some people are more susceptible to substance use disorders than others, almost everyone is at risk of developing a substance use disorder if they abuse substances. 

Dependence / Addiction Criteria -

The DSM-5 outlines 11 different criteria that are used to determine the presence of a substance use disorder.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  The presences of at least two criteria out of 11 to diagnose dependence. Depending upon the number of criteria are fulfilled that apply to a patient will determine the severity of their disorder.

ICD-10 requires three criteria out of six in the past one year to diagnose dependence. 

Tips for assessments 

Depending upon the nature of assessment, patients ability to be cooperative and  professional's years of experience plays crucial in the assessment. 

Good assessment of a substance or drug misuser requires training and competency in the clinician.

An empathetic, non-judgemental approach should be used.

The full assessment process may take several consultations. A drug-misusing patient may present at a time of crisis. An exhaustive initial interview may reduce the chance of them engaging in a treatment programme. However, enough information needs to be obtained in the initial consultation to assess the presenting problems safely.

Relatives or carers should be involved where appropriate.

A multidisciplinary approach to assessment may be needed, as the drug misuser may have associated physical and psychological health problems, social functioning problems and/or be involved with the criminal justice system.

There may be a locally agreed shared assessment process/care pathway already in place.

Once a full assessment has been carried out, a care or treatment plan can be established.

Mental Healthcare Management System (e-MANAS): A digital innovation to implement India‚Äôs Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA 2017)


There is no health without mental health. Recently conducted National Mental Health Survey in India reported a prevalence of 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% current mental morbidity . To address this mammoth problem, an aspirational law was enacted titled ‚ÄúMental Healthcare Act, 2017‚Äù (MHCA
2017) in the parliament. 

The MHCA 2017 promises to protect, promote, and fulfil the rights of persons with mental illness (PMI) as stated in the preamble of the legislation. Further, there is an onus on the state to provide affordable mental health care to its citizens. In India, mental health has always been a lesser priority for lawmakers and citizens alike

MHCA-2017 legalizes ‚Äôadvance directives (AD) where PMI direct future mental health care, choose ‚Äônominated representatives‚Äô (NR) of his/her choice, right to access to psychiatric services, the basic medical records, and to legal aid. This act provide an obligation to state to establish of governmental authorities to oversee services, and to establish ‚ÄôMental Health Review Boards (MHRB)‚Äô to review the admissions, discharge, and to monitor certain prohibitory procedures. It also regulates physical restraint and mental health research. It also mandates registration and online access to information regarding mental health establishments (MHEs) and mental health professionals (MHPs), online access to AD, and NR. In this regard, to register, regulate, monitor, be accountable and be transparent in providing mental health care, the e-MANAS portal was envisioned.

Development process of e-MANAS

MHCA 2017 grants a legally binding right to mental healthcare to over 1.3
billion people . Yet the rule of law that exists on paper does not always translate into practice. In order to be accountable, transparent, responsive and fulfil the obligation under the MHCA, 2017, Karnataka State initiated an Information Technology innovation exercise titled ‚ÄòMental Health Management System‚Äô (e-MANAS; the term manas is a vernacular term to denote ‚Äòmind‚Äô) in collaboration with TeleMedicine Centre, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India and Electronic Health Research Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru, India. Information technology (IT) centric solutions can ensure that legislation and policy decision taken by the government can be quickly executed and implemented at multiple locations, across the length and breadth of the country.

This e-MANAS project was divided into three phases to achieve the objectives: service providers portal, service user portal, and final portal was to integrate first two portals with various other agencies. There were at least 3‚Äì4 focus group discussions (FGDs) with relevant stake-holders at each stage.

The portal has following functionality system

1) Mental Health Registry and Repository is a secured cloud data storage of the complete portal under the State health department

2) Patient Portal - Electronic Health Record - outpatient, registering and
management of advanced directives, nominated representative and grievance redressal mechanisms

3) Private Clinical Establishments ‚Äì seamless data synchronization with the pre-existing e-hospitals of private clinical establishments via Application Programming Interface (portability of data across various platform).

4) Public Clinical Establishments ‚Äì formation of basic mental health records at primary health care, district hospitals and medical colleges

5) Enrolment of Patients ‚Äì identification and integration under health insurance scheme titled Arogya Karnataka ID

6) Mental Health Establishments Register &amp; Professionals Register, which can be accessed by any person to know the availability of services

7) Mental Health Authority Dashboard provides snapshot of the mental
healthcare service performance at each level. This performance dashboard aims to access real time data on mental health indicators for policy makers. This portal promotes government accountability, transparency, monitor and helps to analyse the cost-effective analysis of the mental health programs. Mental Health Review Board dash board for Interactions, Reviews and Audits.

8) Management of Community-based assisted services ‚Äì such as integration with National Mental Health Program (District Mental Health Program and an app developed to help ASHA workers for monitoring of severe mental disorders medications and follow-up for psycho-social needs)

9) Mental Health help-line and mental health ambulance services for persons with mental illness

This MHMS system is provided free of cost to the private and public mental health establishments and mental health professionals across the country.

Prison Mental Health (Correctional Mental Health) Prison Psychiatry [Correctional Psychiatry]

Disproportionately high rate of mental disorders in prisons is related to several factors: the widespread misconception that all people with mental disorders are a danger to the public; the general intolerance of many societies to difficult or disturbing behaviour; the failure to promote treatment, care and rehabilitation, and, above all, the lack of, or poor access to, mental health services in many countries. Many of these disorders may be present before admission to prison, and may be further exacerbated by the stress of imprisonment. However, mental disorders may also develop during imprisonment itself as a consequence of prevailing conditions and also possibly due to torture or other human rights violations inside the prison 

Prisons are bad for mental health: There are factors in many prisons that have negative effects on mental health, including: overcrowding, various forms of violence, enforced solitude or conversely, lack of privacy, lack of meaningful activity, isolation from social networks, insecurity about future prospects (work, relationships, etc), and inadequate health services, especially mental health services, in prisons. The increased risk of suicide in prisons (often related to depression) is, unfortunately, one common manifestation of the cumulative effects of these factors.

For prisoners: 

Addressing mental health needs will improve the health and quality of life of both prisoners with mental disorders and of the prison population as a
whole. By promoting a greater understanding of the problems faced by those with mental disorders, stigma and discrimination can be reduced. Ultimately, addressing the needs of people with mental disorders improves the probability that upon leaving prison they will be able to adjust to community life, which may, in turn, reduce the
likelihood that they will return to prison

For prison employees:

Prisons are often difficult and demanding working environments for all levels of staff. The presence of prisoners with unrecognised and untreated mental disorders can further complicate and negatively affect the prison environment, and place even greater demands upon the staff. A prison that is responsive to, and promotes the mental health of prisoners, is more likely to be a workplace that promotes the overall morale and mental health of prison staff and should therefore be one of the central objectives of good prison management.


For the community: 

Prison health cannot be addressed in isolation from the health of the general population since there is a constant inter-change between the prison
and the broader community, be it through the guards, the administration, the health professionals and the constant admission and release of prisoners. Prison health must therefore be seen as a part of public health. Addressing the mental health needs of prisoners can decrease incidents of re-offending, reduce the number of people who return to prison, help divert people with mental disorders away from prison into treatment and rehabilitation and ultimately reduce the high costs of prisons.

Provide access to acute mental health care in psychiatric wards of general hospitals: When prisoners require acute care they should be temporarily transferred to psychiatric wards of general hospitals with appropriate security levels. In accordance with the principles of de-institutionalisation, special psychiatric prison
hospitals are strongly discouraged (see above under 'The Challenge'). Ensure the availability of psychosocial support and rationally prescribed
psychotropic medication: Prisoners ‚Äì through appropriately trained health care providers - should have the same access to psychotropic medication and psychosocial support for the treatment of mental disorders as people in the general community.

Provide training to staff: Training on mental health issues should be provided to all people involved in prisons including prison administrators, prison guards and health workers. Training should enhance staff understanding of mental disorders, raise awareness on human rights, challenge stigmatizing attitudes and encourage mental
health promotion for both staff and prisoners. An important element of training for all levels of prison staff should be the recognition and prevention of suicides. In addition, prison health workers need to have more specialized skills in identifying and
managing mental disorders. 

Ensure that the needs of prisoners are included in national mental health policies and plans: National mental health policies and/or plans should encompass the mental health needs of the prison population. Where policies and plans fail to do
so it may be necessary to advocate for their inclusion. Whenever a mental health policy or plan is being developed, prisons (staff and prisoners) should be included as stakeholders in the development process.

Post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) diagnosis

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Assessment, Diagnosis, Treatment, Course & Outcome

PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) is a mental health problem that some people develop after experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening traumatic event

DSM-5 Criteria for PTSD

 All of the criteria are required for the diagnosis of PTSD. The following text summarizes the diagnostic criteria:

Criterion A (one required): The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):

Direct exposure
Witnessing the trauma
Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma
Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)


Criterion B (one required): The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):

Unwanted upsetting memories
Nightmares
Flashbacks
Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders
Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders


Criterion C (one required): Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):

Trauma-related thoughts or feelings
Trauma-related reminders

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Assessment, Diagnosis, Treatment, Course & Outcome

PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) is a mental health problem that some people develop after experiencing or witnessing a life-threatening event, like combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assault. During this kind of event, you may not have any control over what's happening, and you may feel very afraid. Anyone who has gone through something like this can develop PTSD.

It's normal to have upsetting memories, feel on edge, or have trouble sleeping after a traumatic event (also called "trauma"). At first, it may be hard to do daily activities you are used to doing, like go to work, go to school, or spend time with people you care about. But most people start to feel better after a few weeks or months. For some people, PTSD symptoms may start later, or they may come and go over time.

DSM-5 Criteria for PTSD

 All of the criteria are required for the diagnosis of PTSD. The following text summarizes the diagnostic criteria:

Criterion A (one required): The person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, in the following way(s):

Direct exposure
Witnessing the trauma
Learning that a relative or close friend was exposed to a trauma
Indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma, usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, medics)


Criterion B (one required): The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced, in the following way(s):

Unwanted upsetting memories
Nightmares
Flashbacks
Emotional distress after exposure to traumatic reminders
Physical reactivity after exposure to traumatic reminders


Criterion C (one required): Avoidance of trauma-related stimuli after the trauma, in the following way(s):

Trauma-related thoughts or feelings
Trauma-related reminders



Criterion D (two required): Negative thoughts or feelings that began or worsened after the trauma, in the following way(s):

Inability to recall key features of the trauma
Overly negative thoughts and assumptions about oneself or the world
Exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma
Negative affect
Decreased interest in activities
Feeling isolated

Forensic Psychiatry Assessment (Detailed evaluation & components of Forensic Psychiatry)

Forensic psychiatry is the sub-specialty of psychiatry dealing with the interface between psychiatry and the law.

A forensic psychiatric evaluation employs in-depth interview techniques of clinical psychiatry, but also relies upon collateral sources of information, addresses more prominently the possibility of malingered (feigned) psychiatric illness, and attempts to answer specific medical-legal (psychiatric) questions. 

The main purpose of evaluation is for assisting in delivery of justice not treatment: indeed, the need for objectivity demands that it be performed outside of a treatment relationship.

Forensic Psychiatrists are called on by the legal system to provide testimony in a wide variety of cases, criminal and civil. In criminal cases, forensic psychiatrists may be asked to comment on the competence of a person to make decisions throughout all the phases of criminal investigation, trial, and punishment. These include the competence to stand trial, to plead guilty, to be sentenced, to waive appeal, and to be executed. In civil cases, forensic psychiatric experts are asked to evaluate a number of civil competences, including competence to make a will or contract or to make decisions about one's person and property. Psychiatrists are also called on to testify about many other issues related to civil cases.

World Organ Donation Day (2021) is observed on August 13, every year to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation and to motivate people for donating organs after death. 

A lost life could light up more lives. Be a real hero by becoming a donor. 

Donating an organ is highly valued, as it is gifting and saving the life of someone, as one organ donor can save up to eight lives.

Organ Donation is retrieving a donor‚Äôs organ like heart, liver, kidneys, intestines, lungs and pancreas, after the donor is deceased, transplanting into another person who is in need of an organ.

All people should consider themselves as possible organ and tissue donors-irrespective of age, health and race. No individual is too old or too young to be a deceased donor. 

There is a wide gap between patients who need transplants and the organs that are available in India. It is not that there aren't enough organs to transplant. Nearly every person who dies naturally, or in an accident, is a potential donor. Even then, innumerable patients cannot find a donor because of lack of awareness, myths, fears, misconceptions, religion, rituals, lack of facilities, affordability and accessibility.    

Organ donation in India is regulated by the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 Amended in 2011. The Government of India enacted the Transplantation of Human Organs Act and amended to curb organ trading and promote deceased organ donation. This law allows both deceased and living donors to donate their organs. It also identifies brain death as a form of death. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) functions as the apex body for activities of relating to procurement, allotment and distribution of organs in the country. 

A website by the name www.notto.nic.in has been hosted where information with regards to the organ transplantation can be obtained. An online system through website is being developed for establishing network for Removal and Storage of Organs and Tissues from deceased donors and their allocation and distribution in a transparent manner. A computerized system of State/Regional and National Registry of donors and recipients is also going to be put in place.



A lost life could light up more lives. We appeal to the family of the deceased to not waste an unfortunate opportunity to help save a life. I would like to make an appeal to you for shedding such notions, and save a life by donating organs.  Let's join hands to bring the gift of life to patients.

Psychological First Aid (PFA) Look, Listen & Link in Psychological First Aid

Psychological First Aid is an evidence-informed modular approach to help children, adolescents, adults, and families in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism. Psychological First Aid is designed to reduce the initial distress caused by traumatic events and to foster short- and long-term adaptive functioning and coping. Principles and techniques of Psychological First Aid meet four basic standards. They are:

- Consistent with research evidence on risk and resilience following trauma
- Applicable and practical in field settings
- Appropriate for developmental levels across the lifespan
- Culturally informed and delivered in a flexible manner

PFA is not traditional psychiatric or professional mental health treatment, but rather a strategy to reduce stress reactions by providing additional support to those who have been affected by a traumatic or emergency incident.

Psychological First Aid does not assume that all survivors will develop severe mental health problems or long-term difficulties in recovery. Instead, it is based on an understanding that disaster survivors and others affected by such events will experience a broad range of early reactions (for example, physical, psychological, behavioral, spiritual). Some of these reactions will cause enough distress to interfere with adaptive coping, and recovery may be helped by support from compassionate and caring disaster responders.

Psychological First Aid is designed for delivery in diverse settings. Mental health and other disaster response workers may be called upon to provide Psychological First Aid in general population shelters, special needs shelters, field hospitals and medical triage areas, acute care facilities (for example, Emergency Departments), staging areas or respite centers for first responders or other relief workers, emergency operations centers, crisis hotlines or phone banks, feeding locations, disaster assistance service centers, family reception and assistance centers, homes, businesses, and other community settings.

Suicide Prevention (Prevention of Deliberate Self Harm) International Suicide Prevention Day 10 Sept

India reported an average of 381 deaths by suicide daily in 2019, totaling 1,39,123 fatalities over the year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. A 3.4 per cent increase was observed in suicides during 2019 (1,39,123 suicides) as compared to 2018 (1,34,516) and 2017 (1,29,887), the data showed. For every 100 suicide deaths, 70% were male and 30% females, the NCRB, which collects data from police recorded cases, stated.

Suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect that impacts on families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies.

 Suicide rates are increasing steadily across the globe. There is an urgent need to have a comprehensive plan to address this issue. In this regard, an editorial was published in IJMR 2019 titled - "Suicide in India: A preventable epidemic" Indian J Med Res. 2019 Oct; 150(4): 324‚Äì327  [Available online at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902368/]  

Suicide prevention programs can be organized at three different levels

(i) National Level (addresses the entire population irrespective of the level of risk of the individuals in the population), 

(ii) Community Level (address at-risk groups with the goal of preventing the onset of suicidal behaviour), and 

(iii) Individual Level. Based on a similar strategy, we propose a model that could be adopted to our Indian setting. 

A suicidal person may not ask for help, but a suicidal attempt is a desperate call for help to escape unbearable pain that the person can see no other option than completing it. Most suicidal individuals give warning signs or signals of their intentions. The best way to prevent suicide is to recognize these warning signs and knowing how to respond to such a crisis situation. There should be a coordinated multi-dimensional, multi-agency, multi-phase, and multi-departmental approach to bring this epidemic under control. This is not just a health issue, but a social issue, and it is everyone's duty to save life. Everyone can save a life, and it is time to act before it is too late.

Cognitive behavioral therapy of obsessive compulsive disorder. CBT for OCD (ERP in OCD) 

Cognitive Behavioral therapy comprises of a variety of techniques used to modify or replace maladaptive thoughts, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive forms of the same. Obsessions and compulsions seen in OCD are examples of maladaptive behaviors as they cause significant distress and interfere with normal functioning of an individual. Behavior therapy helps to remove obsessions and compulsions and thereby ameliorate the distress.

In treating OCD several CBT techniques are used. Of them, ‚ÄúExposure and Response Prevention‚Äù, is the most effective and widely used technique. It is effective in 60-70% of patients suffering from OCD.

The ‚ÄúExposure and Response prevention‚Äù technique based on the principle of ‚Äúhabituation‚Äù of emotions breaks this vicious cycle. What then is habituation? It is based on a simple principle that irrational fears and behavior disappear upon repeated exposure to the sources of fear and anxiety. By repeated and prolonged exposure, the individual gets habituated or used to the anxiety or discomfort to the point where the sources of fear lose their ability to provoke any anxiety, fear or discomfort. However, patients with OCD tend to handle their fear and anxiety by indulging in compulsions and active avoidance of all those situations that could trigger obsessions. On the contrary, in behavior therapy, patient is encouraged to gradually expose oneself to the anxiety-provoking situations and get habituated to the discomfort. And also, the patient is encouraged to not avoid any situations and indulge in compulsions. By preventing oneself from performing compulsions. The anxiety associated with obsession gradually dies on its own. Once the patient get used to anxiety the obsessions and compulsions also gradually disappear.

If patient perform compulsions in response to anxiety related to obsession, than he gets temporary relief. But he has to perform compulsions when ever he gets these obsessions. The only way then to break this vicious cycle is to expose but not to wash hands. By such repeated exposures, the fear of contamination gradually disappears and hence the compulsion of hand-washing also

If a patient doesn‚Äôt perform any compulsion in response to obsession, then anxiety comes down slowly on its own which is called habituation. Then he doesn‚Äôt require performing compulsions whenever he gets these obsessions.

Analysis of the symptoms and implementation of treatment:

1. The first step is careful and detailed documentation of all the obsessions and compulsions.

2. Having done that, all the objects and situations that provokes obsessions and compulsions. Are identified and arranged in a hierarchy of situations from the least anxiety provoking to the most anxiety provoking ones.

3. The information is also obtained about all the objects and situations that the patient avoids to control rituals. For example, a patient may avoid public toilet to prevent having to extensively wash his or her body or clothes. Like objects and situations, certain thoughts and images can also trigger anxiety, panic or discomfort and lead to ritualistic behaviors. For example, blasphemous thoughts may get triggered in a person upon seeing photographs of gods and goddess and visiting temples. To escape from the anxiety the person may end up avoiding temples and praying.

4. In some patients the obsessions and compulsions occur only in home It is very vital to have this information as the treatment has to be accordingly entirely home based, and with full cooperation of other family members.

5. Finally, in some patients, rituals are reinforced by family members ‚Äòco-operation is sought to implement the treatment.

It is important to understand at the outset, that the treatment causes discomfort and that one should be prepared to go through some discomfort to obtain relief ultimately. The speed of habituation of emotional responses varies from person to person. Some may require lesser time (e.g. 30 min) of exposure while others may require repeated long exposures (1-2 hours) before any diminution of the anxiety occurs. Usually the compulsions and rituals are the first to respond and the obsessions take longer to ‚Äúwear out‚Äù. Most show response between 10-12 hours of exposure and response prevention. For a successful outcome, motivation to get well and withstand the discomfort in initial sessions is vital.

Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD treatment)

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness with lifetime prevalence of 1-3%. It is the fourth-most common psychiatric illness and a leading cause of disability. OCD is associated with significant impairment in functioning, quality of life and disability. If untreated, OCD is a chronic illness with a waxing and waning of symptoms. The hallmarks of OCD are presence of obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images or urges that are mostly ego-dystonic and cause severe distress or anxiety. Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviours or mental acts that are performed in response to an obsession to reduce anxiety/distress or prevent a dreaded consequence. Obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming, distressing and are often resisted unsuccessfully. 

OCD is often comorbid with other psychiatric disorders. It is important to assess all patients with OCD for associated psychiatric comorbidity since they may have an effect on treatment outcomes if left untreated. Depression and anxiety disorders are present in over half of patients seeking treatment for OCD.

Meta-analyses of RCTs show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of OCD. SSRIs are associated with many adverse effects but are usually well tolerated. The only other medication which has shown to be consistently effective in OCD is the serotoninergic tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine. Clomipramine has been found to be significantly more effective than placebo in multiple RCTs and meta-analysis of RCTs. Network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of clomipramine vs. SSRIs failed to find any efficacy advantage over SSRIs. Most head-to-head comparison trials have not found any significant difference between the efficacy of clomipramine and SSRIs.


Meta-analyses comparing the different SSRIs and direct head-to-head comparisons have not shown superiority of anyone SSRI over the other. It is generally recommended that OCD be treated with a higher dose of SSRI than that used in depression. 

Guidelines recommend continuation of SSRIs / clomipramine for at least 1-2 years after achieving remission. Clinical experience dictates that discontinuation of medication beyond that period may be associated with increased chance of relapse. Hence discontinuation of medications should be carefully considered based on individual patient factors including severity and duration of illness, past history of relapse on discontinuation, residual symptoms, comorbidities etc. Most patients may require continued pharmacotherapy to prevent relapses. Medications are generally recommended to be continued at the same dose that resulted in improvement, unless the dosage is not tolerated.

Around 20% of patients do not respond to available pharmacological and psychological treatments. Neuromodulatory and neurosurgical treatments targeting the cortico-striato- thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits have been tried in resistant patients.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD Signs, Symptoms, Comorbidity and Insight

The main features of this illness are obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are certain thoughts, doubts, images or urges that occur in one‚Äôs mind. These are unwanted, repetitive by nature. Most people with OCD realize that obsessions are senseless, irrational, or excessive, but they are unable to ignore or suppress them. They would attempt to resist and control them, but would not succeed. Obsessions cause significant distress and anxiety to the sufferers and as a result cause interference in their day to day functioning.

Compulsions are repetitive acts that the person is driven to carry out in spite of knowing that they are meaningless, unnecessary or excessive. Compulsions are usually in response to obsessions. For example, a person with an obsessive fear of contamination washes hands repeatedly in order to ensure that his or her hands are clean. The person attempts to resist repeated hand-washing, but gives in to the urge so as to relieve himself or herself of the anxiety or discomfort. Persons with OCD often perform certain acts repeatedly to avoid some dreaded event or to prevent or undo some harm to themselves or others. For instance, touching the floor even number of times to prevent an accident that one fears might occur to family members. They are aware most of the time that the activity is not connected in a logical or realistic way with what was intended to be achieved, or that it may be clearly excessive (as in the case of hand-washing compulsions), but cannot control them as they reduce anxiety, at least transiently. Some compulsions can be in the form of elaborate ‚Äòrituals‚Äô. Rituals are a particular sequence of actions, which the person is compelled to carry out. On either changing the sequence or missing out one of the actions, anxiety increases driving the person to repeat the set of actions all over again. This would lead to spending considerable time in carrying out even a simple routine activity such as washing hands.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common mental illness. Earlier it was considered as a rare illness, but studies have now shown that 2-3% of the population have OCD at some point in their life. Though OCD is a common illness, many who suffer from this illness do not seek treatment

Some common obsessions:
 - Fear of getting dirty, contaminated or infected by persons or things in the environment.
 
- Blasphemous thoughts.
 
- Thoughts of harming or killing others or oneself.
 
- Recurring thoughts or images of sexual nature.
 
- Fear of blurting out obscenities.

-  Fear of developing a serious life-threatening illness.
 
- Preoccupation to have objects arranged in a certain order or position.


Some common compulsions:
 
- Repeated hand-washing, taking unusually long time to bathe, or cleaning items in the house.

 - Ordering or rearranging things in a certain manner.

 - Checking locks, electrical outlets, gas knobs, light switches etc. repeatedly.

 - Repeatedly putting clothes on, then taking them off.

 - Counting over and over to a certain number.

 - Touching certain objects in a specific way.

 - Repeating certain actions, such as going through a doorway.

 - Constantly seeking approval (especially children).

OCD is a common mental disorder, and is often disabling. In addition, a majority of patients with OCD are at high risk of having one or more co-morbid (co-existing) psychiatric illness. Anxiety disorders (up to 30%) and depression (up to 60%) are the common co-morbid conditions reported in most studies of OCD. 

The most common concurrent psychiatric disorders were major depression (30-55%), social phobia (11-23%), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (18-20%), simple phobia (7-21%), panic disorder (6-12%), eating disorder (8-15%), tic disorders (5-8%) and Tourette‚Äôs syndrome (5%).

In addition to anxiety and depressive disorders, a fascinating group of conditions called obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders are also found to be highly co-morbid with OCD. These include Tourette‚Äôs syndrome and other tic disorders, Hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, and eating disorders. These disorders are considered to be related to OCD because of similarity in clinical picture (morbid preoccupations and compulsive behaviour), high rate of comorbidity, and somewhat similar treatment response. It is extremely important to identify and treat coexisting psychiatric conditions because untreated co-morbid conditions could contribute to poor treatment response and prognosis. Studying comorbidity also helps in understanding the possible etiological relationship between the disorders. 

Co-morbid psychiatric disorders are common in OCD. Depressive and anxiety disorders are the most common co-morbid conditions in OCD.

THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population 

The COVID-19 pandemic can increase the prevalence of mental health problems among the general population because of direct and indirect impact of the covid on human brain. Chronic psychological distress increases the risk of developing physical and mental health conditions such as high blood pressure, digestive problems, autoimmune diseases, sleep disturbances, psychological disorders, and memory and concentration deficits. 

Public health emergencies may affect the health, safety, and well-being of both individuals (causing, for example, insecurity, confusion, emotional isolation, and stigma) and communities (owing to economic loss, work and school closures, inadequate resources for medical response, and deficient distribution of necessities). These effects may translate into a range of emotional reactions (such as distress or psychiatric conditions), unhealthy behaviors (such as excessive substance use), and noncompliance with public health directives (such as home confinement and vaccination) in people who contract the disease and in the general population. Extensive research in disaster mental health has established that emotional distress is ubiquitous in affected populations. 

Those with existing poor mental health are facing a number of risks including increased rates of mental ill health and disruption to treatment, medications and the lifeline of  support services. Studies are showing COVID-19 is likely to trigger relapse among people with pre-existing mental health illness

After disasters, most people are resilient and do not succumb to psychopathology. Indeed, some people find new strengths. Nevertheless, in ‚Äúconventional‚Äù natural disasters, technological accidents, and intentional acts of mass destruction, a primary concern is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arising from exposure to trauma. Medical conditions from natural causes such as life-threatening viral infection do not meet the current criteria for trauma required for a diagnosis of PTSD, but other psychopathology, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, may ensue. 

Education and training regarding psychosocial issues should be provided to health system leaders, first responders, and health care professionals. The mental health and emergency management communities should work together to identify, develop, and disseminate evidence-based resources related to disaster mental health, mental health triage and referral, needs of special populations, and death notification and bereavement care. Risk-communication efforts should anticipate the complexities of emerging issues such as prevention directives, vaccine availability and acceptability, and needed evidence-based interventions relevant to pandemics and should address a range of psychosocial concerns.

What is Criminal Medical Negligence?  Medical Malpractice 

It is common in India to implicate doctors in criminal cases alleging negligence in the death of a patient under treatment. 

In the case of Dr. Suresh Gupta vs. Govt of NCT Delhi, AIR 2004, SC 4091: (2004)6 SCC 42, the Supreme Court of India declared while reviewing the previous order that extreme care and caution should be exercised while initiating criminal proceedings against medical practitioners for alleged medical negligence. 

In a well-considered order, the apex court felt that bonafide medical practitioners should not be put through unnecessary harassment. The court said that doctors would not be able to save lives if they were to tremble with the fear of facing criminal prosecution. In such a case, a medical professional may leave a terminally ill patient to his own fate in an emergency where the chance of survival is poor 


The court held that a simple lack of care, error of judgment, or an accident is not proof of criminal negligence on the part of a medical professional. It requires gross negligence to prosecute a doctor under criminal laws. 


In Jacob Mathew's Case, this Court clearly held that in criminal law medical professionals are placed on a pedestal different from ordinary mortals. It was further held that to prosecute the medical professionals for negligence under criminal law, something more than mere negligence had to be proved. Medical professionals deal with patients and they are expected to take the best decisions in the circumstances of the case.

Sometimes, the decision may not be correct, and that would not mean that the medical professional is guilty of criminal negligence. Such a medical professional may be liable to pay damages but unless negligence of a high order is shown the medical professionals should not be dragged into criminal proceedings.

That is why in Jacob Mathew's case (supra) this Court held that in a case of criminal negligence against a medical professional it must be shown that the accused did something ' grossly negligent'  or failed to do 'grossly negligent' something in the given facts and circumstances of the case which no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence would have done or failed to do. 

In Suresh Gupta‚Äôs case in August 2004 the standard of negligence that had to be proved to fix a doctor‚Äôs or surgeon‚Äôs criminal liability was set at ‚Äúgross negligence‚Äù or ‚Äúrecklessness.‚Äù  If the doctor has adopted the right course of treatment, if she/ he is skilled and has worked with a method and manner best suited to the patient, she/ he cannot be blamed for negligence if the patient is not totally cured.

Covid Grief Counselling in Children and Adolescent 


Coping with loss is difficult, but in the COVID pandemic it‚Äôs even harder and become complicated . Grief is universal. At some point in everyone‚Äôs life, there will be at least one encounter with grief. It is becoming too common in the current COVID-19 crisis that children and families will be confronted with the death of a loved one. It is unavoidable that children will learn of deaths in the family, friends, relatives and community. It may be from the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, the end of a relationship, or any other change that alters life as you know it. 

Grief is also very personal. It doesn‚Äôt follow any timelines or schedules. You may cry, become angry, withdraw, feel empty. None of these things are unusual or wrong. In 1969, a Swiss-American psychiatrist named Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross wrote in her book ‚ÄúOn Death and Dying‚Äù that grief could be divided into five stages. The five stages of grief are: denial /shock, anger, bargaining, depression & acceptance

Not everyone will experience all five stages, and you may not go through them in this order.

Grief is different for every person, so you may begin coping with loss in the bargaining stage and find yourself in anger or denial next. You may remain for months in one of the five stages but skip others entirely. But this pandemic have changed the way we process, express grief and also grieve. 

The covid pandemic has changed the rules of the grieving process and way we perform last rituals / rites . Many families may face the additional pain in an already heartbreaking situation of being unable to say goodbye to a loved one who is dying, to be together in such difficult times, or to go through the usual rites, like a funeral. Hence, virtual funeral services can be planned. In grief adult may forget the children‚Äôs need and may even underestimate the impact of loss on children and Adolescent 

Covid Grief is different from other because of the following:-  

- The loss of life to the coronavirus is sudden

- Family members are unable to grieve, when themselves are afraid of contracting Covid infection. Following a death, and especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, children may worry about what may happen to them or their surviving loved ones and others in the community. Parents should provide reassurance whenever possible about the precautions that are being taken to keep them and their loved ones safe 
 
- Threat perception 
- Feeling helpless 
- Guilt of not doing much to rescue them (like to find bed, oxygen, medications, pay hospital bills and so forth)
- Guilt of transmitting infection to the deceased 
- Unable to be there during last few moments
- No information about the last few moments terrify the family members 
- They can only imagine the last moments of struggling to breath 
- The separation only adds to the grief and sadness of loved ones left behind.
- Guilt of not taking them for testing, for treatment and to the right hospital early 
- Anger on China for spreading illness 
- Anger on people, community, administration, hospital, hospital staff, government and so on 
  
Everyone grieves differently, but there are some commonalities in the stages and the order of feelings experienced during grief. The key to understanding grief is realizing that no one experiences the same thing. Parents/elders should check in intermittently so that kids understand that they can talk at any time about anything that is upsetting them about the death, but they should not be forced to talk about their grief or the person who died if they don‚Äôt want to

If you decide you need help coping with the feelings and changes, a mental health professional is a good resource for vetting your feelings and finding a sense of assurance in these very heavy and weighty emotions.

There are simple steps such as 

Virtual funeral (covid) to facilitate grief 

1: Rapport Building 

2: Talking about the deceased - Young children may need some explanation about what death means. ‚ÄúThere are no right words, but it‚Äôs important to convey that it is a permanent state and that people can‚Äôt come back from it. it‚Äôs important to use the words death or died, rather than other language like ‚Äòpassed away‚Äô as this may leave room for confusion about what has happened

3: Talking about the circumstances about the death
 
4: Ventilation

5: Any thoughts of responsibility / guilt feeling   

6: To accept the reality of the loss. 

7: To process the pain of the loss. 

8: To adjust to a world without the deceased.  

9: To find a way to remember the deceased while embarking on the rest of one‚Äôs journey through life. 

These tasks are not meant to be a fixed progression, instead: Tasks can be revisited and worked through again and again over time. Various tasks can also be worked on at the same time. Grieving is a fluid process

What is Medical Negligence? What are the components and different types of medical negligence?  

Negligence is the breach of a legal duty to care. A breach of this duty gives a patient the right to initiate action against negligence.

Doctors in India may be held liable for their services individually or vicariously. Doctors must exercise an ordinary degree of skill. However, they cannot give a warranty of the perfection of their skill or a guarantee of cure. If the doctor has adopted the right course of treatment, if she/ he is skilled and has worked with a method and manner best suited to the patient, she/ he cannot be blamed for negligence if the patient is not totally cured.

If it can be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not capable of withstanding the logical analysis, the court would be entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible‚Äù

Breaking Bad News: Spikes Protocol for Healthcare Professionals  

Conveying bad news is a skilled communication, and not at all easy. The amount of truth to be disclosed is subjective. A properly structured and well-orchestrated communication has a positive therapeutic effect.

Lack of sufficient training in breaking bad news is a handicap to most physicians and health care workers. Adherence to the principles of client-centered counseling is helpful in attaining this skill. Fundamental insight of the patient is exploited and the bad news is delivered in a structured manner, because the patient is the one who knows what is hurting him most and he is the one who knows how to move forward. Six-step SPIKES protocol is widely used for breaking bad news

This model was given by Baile WF, Buckman R, Lenzi R, Glober G, Beale EA, Kudelka AP (2000) SPIKES PROTOCOL. This acronym 'SPIKES" nevertheless helps memories the steps and consider their elements

STEP 1: SETTING UP the Interview
STEP 2: Assessing the Patient‚Äôs PERCEPTION
STEP 3: Obtaining the Patient‚Äôs INVITATION
STEP 4: Giving KNOWLEDGE and Information to the Patient
STEP 5: Addressing the Patient‚Äôs EMOTIONS with empathic responses

What is Bolam Test? What is the role of Bolam test in Medical Negligence Case? (Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee) 


The Bolam test was established in 1957 following the decision of the court in Bolam v Friern hospital management in which the court concluded that a doctor might be able to avoid a claim for negligence if he can prove that other medical professionals would have acted in the same way.  This is a landmark celebrity case in the history of medial negligence or professional misconduct case. 

The High Court of UK held that the doctor had not breached his duty to the patient, and so the defendant was not liable. 

McNair J set out the test for determining the standard of care owed by medical professionals to their patients (sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄòBolam test‚Äô). The professional will not be in breach of their duty of care if they acted in a manner which was in accordance with practices accepted as proper by a responsible body of other medical professionals with expertise in that particular area. If this is established, it does not matter that there are others with expertise who would disagree with the practice.

Bolam Test is accepted in Indian Court of Law.

Covid Grief Counselling (Covid Grief Therapy) and Coping with Pandemic related Grief    

Coping with loss is difficult, but in the COVID pandemic it‚Äôs even harder and complicated in lockdown. Grief is universal. At some point in everyone‚Äôs life, there will be at least one encounter with grief. It may be from the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, the end of a relationship, or any other change that alters life as you know it.

Grief is also very personal. It‚Äôs not very neat or linear. It doesn‚Äôt follow any timelines or schedules. You may cry, become angry, withdraw, feel empty. None of these things are unusual or wrong. In 1969, a Swiss-American psychiatrist named Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross wrote in her book ‚ÄúOn Death and Dying‚Äù that grief could be divided into five stages. The five stages of grief are: denial /shock, anger, bargaining, depression & acceptance

Description of video 329:
Testamentary capacity is the legal term used to describe a person's legal and mental ability to make or alter a valid will. If the person making the will (testator) lacks testamentary capacity at the time that the will is executed, the will is invalid.

The test for capacity to execute a valid will is based in case law (Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549)

A testator must:

1. Understand the nature of making a will and its effects.
2. Understand the extent of the property of which they are disposing.
3. Be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which they ought to give effect.
4. Have no disorder of the mind that perverts their sense of right or prevents the exercise of their natural faculties in disposing of their property by will.

The level of understanding required by the test varies according to the complexity of the will itself, the testator's assets and the claims on the testator (Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549).

If the above factors are present, a court would likely find that the testator had testamentary capacity and that the will is valid, excluding any other circumstances.  These are the questions that should be asked, explored and discussed before someone signs their will.  Otherwise, they will be asked after the testator is deceased and someone is unhappy with their inheritance.

Addressing Tobacco use in Primary Health Centre (Tobacco Dependence Treatment)

There are 27.5 crores adult tobacco users in India and this is a major public health challenge. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers (at the primary care) all have the potential to lead successful tobacco cessation interventions.

It is without doubt now that the most effective and low cost preventive intervention that a clinician can provide for tobacco using patients against heart disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and tuberculosis is an empathic tobacco cessation intervention

Nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) have been shown to further double the chances of successfully quitting smoking when used in conjunction with physician's advice. There are many advantages of delivery of tobacco cessation services through designated primary care physicians. This will reduce the cost of long term care and patient will get help in determining the need for avoidable expensive treatment. Primary care practitioners are ideally positioned to intervene with their patients who smoke and use smokeless tobacco

The focus of this year‚Äôs World No Tobacco Day, May 31, is on protecting young people from the marketing of big tobacco companies and helping them avoid using tobacco and nicotine. Each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) sponsors this awareness day to highlight the health risks of using tobacco and to encourage governments to put policies into action that help to reduce smoking and the use of other tobacco products.

According to WHO, tobacco use kills more than 8 million people around the world each year, a number that is predicted to grow unless anti-tobacco actions are increased. In the United States, tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of death and disease. It causes many types of cancer, as well as heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and other health problems. According to WHO, tobacco companies use many ways to appeal to young people, sell more and more cancer sticks to make money.

Common experiences include:

hallucination: hearing, seeing or feeling things that are not there;

a) delusion: fixed false beliefs or suspicions not shared by others in the person‚Äôs culture and that are firmly held even when there is evidence to the contrary;

b) abnormal behaviour: disorganised behaviour such as wandering aimlessly, mumbling or laughing to self, strange appearance, self-neglect or appearing unkempt;

World Schizophrenia Day 2022  (World Schizophrenia Day May 24th) 

Schizophrenia is a psychosis, a type of mental illness characterized by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behaviour. 


Challenges faced during this pandemic are 

- stress 
- non-availability of medications 
- lockdown and unable to visit psychiatrist for prescription 
- loss of job / occupation (during the downhill course of any market person with mental illness are removed from the job) 
- they are not prioritized in vaccination drive
- relapse and family members burnout 
- access to internet or social media is denied by family members (for many reasons) 
- self help groups for schizophrenia are non-existent (only few operate in metropolitan cities)
- physical and verbal abuse by family members 
- homeless mentally ill person status not know during the lockdown 

Worldwide, schizophrenia is associated with considerable disability and may affect educational and occupational performance.

People with schizophrenia are 2-3 times more likely to die early than the general population. This is often due to preventable physical diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and infections.

Stigma, discrimination and violation of human rights of people with schizophrenia is common.
Schizophrenia is treatable. Treatment with medicines and psychosocial support is effective.

Facilitation of assisted living, supported housing and supported employment are effective management strategies for people with schizophrenia.

Covid Grief | Bereavement | Loss | Coping with Pandemic related Grief    

Coping with loss is difficult, but in the COVID pandemic it‚Äôs even harder and become complicated. Grief is universal. At some point in everyone‚Äôs life, there will be at least one encounter with grief. It may be from the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, the end of a relationship, or any other change that alters life as you know it.

Grief is also very personal. It‚Äôs not very neat or linear. It doesn‚Äôt follow any timelines or schedules. You may cry, become angry, withdraw, feel empty. None of these things are unusual or wrong. In 1969, a Swiss-American psychiatrist named Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross wrote in her book ‚ÄúOn Death and Dying‚Äù that grief could be divided into five stages. The five stages of grief are: denial /shock, anger, bargaining, depression & acceptance

Not everyone will experience all five stages, and you may not go through them in this order.

Grief is different for every person, so you may begin coping with loss in the bargaining stage and find yourself in anger or denial next. You may remain for months in one of the five stages but skip others entirely. But this pandemic have changed the way we process, express grief and also grieve. 

The covid pandemic has changed the rules of the grieving process and way we perform last rituals / rites . 

Covid Grief is different from other because of the following:-  

- The loss of life to the coronavirus is sudden
- Family members are unable to grieve, when themselves are afraid of contracting Covid infection 
- Threat perception 
- Feeling helpless 
- Guilt of not doing much to rescue them (like to find bed, oxygen, medications, pay hospital bills and so forth)
- Guilt of transmitting infection to the deceased 
- Unable to be there during last few moments
- No information about the last few moments terrify the family members 
- They can only imagine the last moments of struggling to breath 
- The separation only adds to the grief and sadness of loved ones left behind.
- Guilt of not taking them for testing, for treatment and to the right hospital early 
- Anger on China for spreading illness 
- Anger on people, community, administration, hospital, hospital staff, government and so on 
  
Everyone grieves differently, but there are some commonalities in the stages and the order of feelings experienced during grief. The key to understanding grief is realizing that no one experiences the same thing. Grief is very personal, and you may feel something different every time. You may need several weeks, or grief may be years long.

If you decide you need help coping with the feelings and changes, a mental health professional is a good resource for vetting your feelings and finding a sense of assurance in these very heavy and weighty emotions.

Oxygen shortage and liability on doctors   

Hospitals designated COVID-19 treatment centers across India have raised concern over an imminent shortage or lack of supply of liquid medical oxygen. 

This difficult situation of lack of oxygen was further  worsened by an advocate commenting on social media and also in main stream media encouraging public to sue the hospitals and doctors if there is shortage of oxygen supply. 

This comment of an advocate to sue the doctors triggered panic among the doctors. Many doctors started seeking legal opinion and few hesitating to go to work in the background of being sued, if oxygen shortage occurs. 

This video examines the legal liability on doctors, if there is a oxygen shortage in hospital

Impact of Covid Panic 


Panic attack is a distinct episode of anxiety. It is usually characterized by pounding heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, feelings of choking, chest pain, nausea, stomach ache, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, feeling of losing control, overwhelming fear of death, tingling, and chills. Living during this time of pandemic is a new experience to the majority of the population all over the world. COVID-19 is not lethal to the majority but it is one of the pandemics that paralyzes not only our society but also our psychological well being. This panic results in selfishness such as panic buying, hoarding, stigma, discrimination and believing in every news item seen in social media. With this, other people are left scarce of essential commodities. It is also very evident that people tend to exploit resources in times of wide distress. Since the start of the COVID-19 scare, few unethical business establishments and psychopaths took the opportunity to increase prices on the basic necessities.

Medical malpractice is an act of negligence committed by a medical provider, a physician in most situations. It is defined as doing something a medical provider of ordinary skill would not have done, or failing to do that which a medical provider of ordinary skill would have done.  To establish a medical malpractice claim, there must be injury and damage to the patient directly resulting from the negligence

Medical Negligence has many manifestations - it may be active negligence, collateral negligence, comparative negligence, concurrent negligence, continued negligence, criminal negligence, gross negligence, hazardous negligence, active and passive negligence, willful or reckless negligence or Negligence per se

A doctor can be held liable for negligence only if it can be proved that he/she is responsible of a failure that no other doctor with ordinary skills would be guilty of it, if acting with reasonable care. A slip in judgment constitutes negligence only if a professional who is reasonably competent with the standard skills and has acted with ordinary care, would not have made the same error.

In the Supreme Court landmark judgement Jacob Mathew  v. State of Punjab and Anr. [(2005) 6 SCC 1]. In paragraph 41 of the decision, the Court observed that: 

"The practitioner must bring to his task a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence is what the law requires."

The consequences of legally cognizable medical negligence can broadly be put into three categories:

(i) Criminal liability, 
(ii) monetary liability, and 
(iii) disciplinary action (cancel of medical / license registration)

Doctors owe a duty of care towards the patients in emergency situation but at the same time it is the responsibility of the patients as well to cooperate with the medical professionals in discharge of their duties. 

To err is human that doesn't give right to patients or their family members to attack or abuse the doctors. No way is it justified. If, there is negligence in that case legal route should be adopted.

Description of video 344:
Testamentary capacity is the legal term used to describe a person's legal and mental ability to make or alter a valid will. If the person making the will (testator) lacks testamentary capacity at the time that the will is executed, the will is invalid.

The test for capacity to execute a valid will is based in case law (Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549)

A testator must:

1. Understand the nature of making a will and its effects.
2. Understand the extent of the property of which they are disposing.
3. Be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which they ought to give effect.
4. Have no disorder of the mind that perverts their sense of right or prevents the exercise of their natural faculties in disposing of their property by will.

The level of understanding required by the test varies according to the complexity of the will itself, the testator's assets and the claims on the testator (Banks v Goodfellow (1870) LR 5 QB 549).

If the above factors are present, a court would likely find that the testator had testamentary capacity and that the will is valid, excluding any other circumstances.  These are the questions that should be asked, explored and discussed before someone signs their will.  Otherwise, they will be asked after the testator is deceased and someone is unhappy with their inheritance.

Panic Disorder I Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia I Panic Attack

People with panic disorder have sudden and repeated attacks of fear (panic attacks) that last for several minutes or longer. Panic attacks are characterized by a fear of death or disaster or of losing control even when there is no real danger. It may feel like having a heart attack or impending dome of death. Panic attacks can occur at any time, and many people with panic disorder worry about and dread the possibility of having another attack (Anticipatory anxiety) 


Physical symptoms during a panic attack, such as a pounding or racing heart, sweating, chills, trembling, breathing problems, weakness or dizziness, tingly or numb hands, chest pain, stomach pain, and nausea An intense worry about when the next panic attack will happen
A fear or avoidance of places where panic attacks have occurred in the past

A person with panic disorder may become discouraged and feel ashamed because he or she cannot carry out normal routines like going to school or work, going to the grocery store, or driving.

Panic disorder often begins in the late teens or early adulthood. More women than men have panic disorder. But not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder.

Panic disorder sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don‚Äôt. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain, as well as biological processes, play a key role in fear and anxiety. Some researchers think that people with panic disorder misinterpret harmless bodily sensations as threats. By learning more about how the brain and body functions in people with panic disorder, scientists may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and environmental factors may play a role.

Doctors also may prescribe different types of medications to help treat panic disorder: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), Beta-blockers & 
Benzodiazepines

SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly used to treat depression, but they are also helpful for the symptoms of panic disorder. They may take several weeks to start working. 

Another type of medication called beta-blockers can help control some of the physical symptoms of panic disorder, such as rapid heart rate. Although doctors do not commonly prescribe beta-blockers for panic disorder, they may be helpful in certain situations that precede a panic attack.

Benzodiazepines, which are sedative medications, are powerfully effective in rapidly decreasing panic attack symptoms, but they can cause tolerance and dependence if you use them continuously. Therefore, your doctor will only prescribe them for brief periods of time if you need them.

Don‚Äôt give up on treatment too quickly. Both psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work. A healthy lifestyle can also help combat panic disorder. Make sure to get enough sleep and exercise, eat a healthy diet, and turn to family and friends who you trust for support.

Capacity to consent assessment for Persons with Mental illness under Mental Healthcare Act, 2017

Capacity to Consent - Mental capacity refers to the ability of an individual to make one's own decisions. Decision-making capacity has been described as the ‚Äúkey to autonomy‚Äù and an important ingredient of informed consent. Limited or impaired mental capacity embarks on a minefield of ethical and legal issues, which doctors need to be aware of while dealing with a particular patient.

Persons with mental illness may have to take treatment (as prophylaxis to avoid relapse) for many years even after improving from the illness. Now, the main issue arises is how much leverage needs to be given on, ‚Äúright to autonomy‚Äù (mental capacity) with regard to consent for the treatment or admission versus keeping the ‚Äúlarger interest of the society‚Äù from dangerousness of the persons with mental illness if he refuses treatment and relapses. There should be some balance between the ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù (autonomy) versus the ‚Äúsafety of the society‚Äù (larger interest of the society). In developed countries, right to autonomy has been coupled with the casting of obligation with compulsory community treatment order on patients, who is refusing to take much-needed treatment (prophylaxis) while in the community. In India, the family plays an important role in providing care for persons with mental illness and the community care order will be a boon providing an additional tool for the care giver. The inclusion of compulsory community treatment orders may play a significant role in providing care for the chronically ill patients and also better lives of the family members and care givers while in the community. Hence, there is a need to have a place for community treatment orders in the legislative process.

There are issues related to capacity to make decisions related to mental healthcare and treatment, and this may have serious consequences because. Section 4 of MHCA 2017, capacity to make mental health care and treatment decisions, is flawed and can have dangerous consequences. In a nutshell, this section dictates capacity in relation to the ability of the patient to (a) comprehend the information or (b) assess risk or (c) communicate his/her decision. If he/she has any one of the above components, a PMI can refuse treatment. That means a psychiatrist will only be able to provide treatment for the minority of the PMI, with difficulty. Hence, there is an urgent need for clarification and for a guidance document to be released for the assessment of the mental capacity, and amendments need to occur for the Section 4. The Section 4 needs to be amended by deleting ‚Äúor‚Äù and introducing ‚Äúand‚Äù between 4 a, b, and c 

A PMI may refuse treatment due to (a) absent insight, (b) severe symptoms, or (c) his/her symptoms coming in the way of decision-making. Family members usually find it difficult to manage individuals with serious mental illness who have no insight, and usually, such patients refuse admission and treatment. Chapter 2, Section 4, by default, considers everyone to have capacity, and before initiating involuntary treatment, one has to prove that a PMI lacks capacity. In such context, act gives a provision to treat the patients through a valid advance directive (AD) or in its absence, a NR. Where there is no AD or NR appointed by a person, the law assumes relative or caregiver as NR for the admission and treatment-related decision.


MHCA of 2017 focuses mainly on the human rights of PMI. It is prudent for the lawmaker to account for the culture of the land, newer scientific developments in the mental health field, analyze the met-unmet needs of the patients and families, and make provisions to bridge the treatment gap. There is also a need to make provisions to enhance the resources and skill building among professionals/workers in the field of mental health, to provide comprehensive healthcare services, to promote mental health and well-being, and to make provisions for adequate financial support/budget (for plan and nonplan expenditures).

Spread hope, not fear in this pandemic. Spread hope, not Covid 

All healthcare workers and frontline workers need hope, or else we cannot endure.......longer.   

The Covid pandemic never approached the lethality of the Spanish flu of 1918 or epidemic of Ebola virus or Nipah Virus outbreak. Yet the effect that our fears, amplified by the mass/social media, had on society were infinitely more debilitating.  Spreading hope and encouragement will be contagious, and our society will be saved from this spiral of fear, hatred, and despair that we are witnessing.

The campaign calls on all citizens of this globe to join together to ‚ÄúSpread Hope, Not fear‚Äù by taking actions that will significantly reduce the spread of the virus including wearing masks, washing and sanitizing hands, practicing physical distancing, and more. Hope is required to all those battling in hospitals (both patients and healthcare workers) for life in those dark hours. This is the time, we need to instill hope till our last breath. 

Darkness comes, hits us. In the middle of it, the future looks blank. The temptation to quit is huge. Temptation to criticize those providing care and resisting to give up. You will argue with yourself that there is no way forward.     

A positive statement and encouragement propels hope toward a better future, it builds up your faith and that of others, and it promotes change. Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all. 
Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship and fight today.  

All healthcare workers and frontline workers need hope, or else we cannot endure.......longer. Already more than one year, healthcare workers and frontline workers are fighting 24/7 past 14months 

Spread hope .... not fear 
Spread hope .... not covid

An open letter to the friends in the media regarding reporting of Covid Crisis  

Media the fourth pillar of our democracy -  with great power comes great responsibility, this responsibility acquires even greater importance in this crisis. Mass media and social media has the power to communicate to millions at the same time. When the reach is so huge, every word, every image and every nuance matters. However, what we are seeing on our TV screens, mobile screens and newspapers is disconcerting, to put it very mildly. Images of bodies burning in cremation grounds, dead bodies, ICU sufferings, relatives of the deceased wailing inconsolably, emotional outbursts and hysterical reporters with cameramen swarming over the bereaved who are going through deeply emotional moments ‚Äì these may help garner eyeballs. But there is a steep price to be paid for such coverage - giving up hope. 

Humble appeal to the news media. Don't break it- if you can't boost our morale. 

All day long only showing helpless families roaming around, showing death, burning pyres/cremation doesn't do any good to us or to the frontline workers. What do you want to prove after providing the same panic information thousand times and spreading panic? Please give information without dramatization, music, blurred images and uphold the confidentiality of the patients. 


We all know that there is an epidemic going on, we also know that it is enough to say that there is no control over the situation, there are many reasons for the current situation. You have highlighted it, but you continue to do the same panic by showing panic images


Help to solve the problems.

- show interviews to recovered patients

-  explain how to cope during Covid 

- what helps to face the situation

- how to prepare ourselves

- help in searching and let us know where to find oxygen cylinder

- show bottlenecks and try to find solutions

- give information without sensationalizing it

- show and encourage NGOs work

- interview frontline workers and encourage them

- provide information how many beds of which hospital are empty

- provide Ambulance Service Details

- provide information on various issues on covid relates

- Encourage everyone to serve

- Appeal everyone to vaccinate

- Provide information about where and what benefits are available

- interview nurses / ANM and encourage them 

- interview hospital supporting staff and encourage them 

- provide information on where and where to find doctors

- provide information on corrupt politicians/officials/hospitals/private, who are looting the public at large

Imagine someone has just tested positive for COVID-19. If they have witnessed these panic-inducing coverage from cremation grounds. it keeps weighing on their minds and that of their loved ones. 

The fact that a huge number of people who are infected by COVID-19 recover becomes immaterial. Only images of death. cremating emotions stay with them. This triggers panic of blocking of beds, buying medications, hoarding oxygen cylinders and antisocial elements selling the required commodities at the higher price creates a huge fear in pandemic.

In such times, the media has great power to inform, educate and most importantly, infuse hope in the people. This includes the sharing of authentic information and allaying of fears. These are extremely important weapons in this fight against the pandemic. Therefore, we request our friends in the media to show restraint in their coverage without compromising upon facts or public interest

World Mental Health Day 2021- Theme - Mental Health in an unequal World 

The objective of World Mental Health Day celebration is to raise awareness of mental health issues around the world and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health.

During this pandemic the world is increasingly polarized, with the very wealthy becoming wealthier, and the number of people living in poverty still far too high. 2020 highlighted inequalities due to economy, access to vaccine, access to health care and the lack of respect for human rights in many countries, including for people living with mental health conditions. Such inequalities have an impact on people‚Äôs mental health.

The Day provides an opportunity for all stakeholders working on mental health issues to talk about their work, and what more needs to be done to make mental health care a reality for people worldwide. 

The economic consequences of the pandemic are already being felt, as companies let staff go in an effort to save their businesses, or indeed shut down completely. Given past experience of emergencies, it is expected that the need for mental health and psychosocial support will substantially increase in the coming months and years. Lack of investment in mental health disproportionate to the overall health budget contributes to the mental health treatment gap.  

Many people with a mental illness do not receive the treatment that they are entitled to and deserve and together with their families and carers continue to experience stigma and discrimination. The gap between the ‚Äòhaves‚Äô and the ‚Äòhave nots‚Äô grows ever wider and there is continuing unmet need in the care of people with a mental health problem.

Everyone goes through periods of deep sadness and grief. Everyone feels sad or low sometimes, but these feelings usually pass with a little time. 
These feelings usually fade away within a few days or weeks, depending on the circumstances. 

But in certain circumstances profound sadness that lasts more than two weeks and affects individual's ability to function may be a sign of depression. Depression (also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression) is different. It can cause severe symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working. It is an illness that can affect anyone‚Äîregardless of age, race, income, culture, or education. Research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression.

Depression is a mood disorder that involves a persistent feeling of sadness, easy fatiguability and loss of interest. It is different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life.


Depression may occur with other mental disorders and other illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and chronic pain. Depression can make these conditions worse, and vice versa. Sometimes medications taken for these illnesses cause side effects that contribute to depression symptom



Common symptoms of depression include:

- Persistent sad, anxious, or ‚Äúempty‚Äù mood
- Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
- Feelings of irritability, frustration‚Äö or restlessness
- Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
- Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies or activities
- Decreased energy, fatigue, or being ‚Äúslowed down‚Äù
- Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions
- Difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping
- Changes in appetite or unplanned weight changes
- Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems without a clear physical cause and that do not ease even with treatment
- Suicide attempts or thoughts of death or suicide



There are many possible causes, and sometimes, various factors combine to trigger symptoms.

Factors that are likely to play a role include:

genetic features
changes in the brain‚Äôs neurotransmitter levels
environmental factors
psychological and social factors


Depression treatment typically involves medication, psychotherapy, or both. If these treatments do not reduce symptoms, brain stimulation therapy may be another treatment option. In milder cases of depression, treatment might begin with psychotherapy alone, and medication added if the individual continues to experience symptoms. For moderate or severe depression, many mental health professionals recommend a combination of medication and therapy at the start of treatment.

Choosing the right treatment plan should be based on a person‚Äôs individual needs and medical situation under a provider‚Äôs care. It may take some trial and error to find the treatment that works best for you. You can learn more about the different types of treatment, including psychotherapy, medication, and brain stimulation therapies

Counseling is defined as the process of assisting and guiding clients, especially by a trained person on a professional basis, to resolve especially personal, social, or psychological problems and difficulties. It requires a set of learned skills to do effective counseling. Mastering particular counseling skills could make a great difference in whether or not you can provide your clients with the best opportunities to empowering them. There are a variety of skills that are beneficial to a counselor's understanding of their client, and to the client's overall comfort and willingness to be vulnerable about their personal hardships. Here is a list of useful skills that counselors should have:

Active listening for counseling 
Active listening is an important skill for a counselor to have. It can be defined as the use of eye contact, facial expressions and gestures to imply that you are engaged and focused on the information the other person is saying. It can help a client feel like they've been heard and validated in the information they chose to share.

Open-ended Questioning
There are two types of questioning styles that a counselor should be able to utilize‚Äîopen questioning and closed questioning. Being skilled in questioning techniques can help a counselor to better interpret what a client is saying and it can help them think more deeply into their personal situation as well. Open questioning includes all questioning that is directed toward gathering more detailed and complex information. Closed questioning is directed toward more short-ended questions with specific answers.

Documentation during sessions 
Counselors should be skilled in organized note-taking techniques in order to record important points that were discussed during the session and information the client provided. This can be used for further analysis later on.

Nonverbal communication in counseling 
Similar to information interpretation, counselors should be able to identify current attitudes or feelings based upon the body language that a client uses during the session.

Genuineness and Trustworthiness
An important skill for a counselor is to be able to build and maintain trust with their clients. This can affect a client's willingness to share information.

Empathy
A counselor needs to be able to see a client's situation from their perspective in order to best help them overcome their obstacles.

Confidentiality
Confidentiality can be seen as a valued skill for a counselor to have as they must respect their clients and the information they share with them.

Telepsychiatry Operational Guidelines (2020) of India  I Telemental Health 2020 I Telepsychotherapy 

Telepsychiatry in the form of interactive videoconferencing has become a critical tool in the delivery of mental health care in this contemporary world. To enable this telepsychiatry services Psychiatrist shall comply with licensure laws by enrolling in the State Medical Register or the Indian Medical Register under the Indian Medical Council Act 1956 / NMC Act, 2019. Further, all psychiatrists intending to provide online consultation need to complete a mandatory online course within 3 years of its notification by the Board of Governors, in supersession of the Medical Council of India.

Telepsychiatry Operational guidelines 2020  - Available online at https://indianpsychiatricsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Telepsychiatry-Operational-Guidelines-2020-Inaug.pdf

This report represents a collaboration between the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore and the Indian Psychiatry Services to create a resource guide in telepsychiatry for practicing psychiatrist. These guidelines focus mainly on interactive videoconferencing-based psychiatry services.  

This is a telepsychiatry resource guide intended for psychiatrists practicing in India. The guidelines focus primarily on video-based telepsychiatry services, unlike the telemedicine guidelines that included audio and text-based consultations as well. The guidelines aim to empower psychiatrists across the nation to initiate and implement telepsychiatric services. The guide emphasizes that the psychiatrist should be observant of the provisions of laws (MHCA 2017, especially) pertinent to the
practice of medicine and mental health.

Psychiatrists should also uphold professional clinical standards while practicing telepsychiatry, similar to the traditional in-person psychiatry practice The guidelines outline the medico-legal issues that may arise during the online consultation and lay specific suggestions to avoid such concerns. The guidelines reiterate that the professional should avoid advertisements about the practice in social media and online platforms. A framework for setting up telepsychiatry services with hardware and software technology standards is outlined. The guide advises choosing telemedicine software, which is simple, user friendly, and effective. Clear suggestions are provided to maintain the basic medical record in either physical or virtual form. In accordance with the existing laws, a structured format is provided that would help to maintain patient health records for first and subsequent visits. The need to obtain explicit consent from the patient before recording the consultation is emphasized. Importantly, the step-bystep operational procedure to be followed before, during, and after telepsychiatry consultation is elaborated in detail. The guidelines also provide a specific format for caregiver-initiated consultations. The caregiver initiating a psychiatric consultation is common in our country. This provision in the guidelines would avoid unnecessary professional and legal dilemmas while rendering the needed service and streamlines the provisions of the Telemedicine practice guidelines.

The guidelines specify the clinical scenarios where the telepsychiatry consultation needs to be stopped, and the concerned person is to be referred for in-person assessment and management. The role of a psychiatrist during the collaborative telepsychiatric consultation between a psychiatrist and a health worker is explained. The importance of availing adequate information and arriving at a provisional diagnosis before prescribing psychotropic medications is reiterated.

The guidelines classify the available psychotropic medications into groups/List O, A, B, and C in accordance with the Telemedicine practice guidelines. This simplifies and enables the psychiatrist to choose a specific drug for the denoted purpose. Telepsychotherapy is also encouraged after initial in-person detailed assessment. A set of guiding principles are provided for practicing telepsychotherapy. 

The release of the telemedicine and telepsychiatry guidelines has come as a timely measure during this COVID pandemic as it will help to reach the unreached during the restrictions. These are not to be seen as an alternative to lack of human resources but an essential first step in ensuring the equitable distribution of available resources. These guidelines might provide impetus in taking health service delivery to service user‚Äôs doorstep.

District Mental Health Program of India I DMHP 1984 I

District Mental health Programme (Under the National Mental Health Programme 1996‚Äì97) was successfully developed by National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore in the Bellary district of Karnataka, and it is conceived as a model and adopted by all States for implementation.

The major components of District Mental Health Programme as adopted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are:-

1. Training programme for all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.

2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.

3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.

4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the State and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research.

 5. To provide sustainable basic mental health services to the community and to integrate these services with other health services;

6. To ensure that patients and their relatives do not have to travel long distances to go to hospitals or nursing home in cities;

7. To take the pressure off from mental hospitals;

8. To reduce the stigma attached towards mental illness through change of attitude and public education; and

9.  To treat and rehabilitate mental patients discharged from the mental hospital within the community.

Key Features of DMHP 

1. The States will set in motion the process of finding suitable personnel for manning the DMHP teams. They can take in service candidates who are willing to serve in this pilot project and provide them the necessary training in the identified institution.

2. The patients will be from the district itself and the adjoining areas.

3. District Mental Health Team will be expected to provide service to the needy mentally ill patients and their families, such as‚Äîdaily out-patient service, ten bedded in-service facilities, referral service and liaison with the primary health centres, follow up service, awareness programmes, and also community survey if feasible

The DMHP also has its share of criticism across the verticals of prestigious mental health institutions in the country. The national strategy of integrating mental health with existing primary care services addresses both the scant resources and the challenges of serving a large and diverse country. While there is no disputing that the country‚Äôs mental health programmes were initiated
with bold and well-meaning objectives, numerous problems continue to thwart implementation of these programmes. Several of the logistical and administrative difficulties have been detailed in public health and psychiatric publications. Significantly, however, a historical and cultural analysis of the major forces that have shaped the discipline is conspicuously absent in the published literature

National Mental Health Program of India (NMHP 1982) 

It is estimated that 10% of population suffers from mental disorders at any given point in time.  One in four families is likely to have at least one member with a behavioral or mental disorder (WHO 2001). These families not only provide physical and emotional support, but also bear the negative impact of stigma and discrimination. Most of them  remain un-treated. Poor awareness about symptoms of mental illness, myths & stigma related to it, lack of knowledge on the treatment availability & potential benefits of seeking treatment are important causes for the high treatment gap. 

The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, with the following objectives:

- To ensure the availability and accessibility of minimum mental healthcare for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population;

- To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general healthcare and in social development; and

- To promote community participation in the mental health service development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community.

In the XI Five Year Plan, the NMHP has the following components/schemes:

1. District Mental Health Programme (DMHP)

2. Manpower Development Schemes - Centers Of Excellence And Setting Up/Strengthening PG Training Departments of Mental Health Specialities

3. Modernization Of State Run Mental Hospitals

4. Up gradation of Psychiatric Wings of Medical Colleges/General Hospitals

5. IEC

6. Training & Research

7. Monitoring & Evaluation

Manpower Development Schemes - Centers of Excellence and Setting Up/Strengthening PG Training Departments of Mental Health Specialities are the new schemes/components.

As the NMHP, has completed more than three decades, the lessons learned from the past can bring about a lot of insights about the future course of action. Leadership at all the levels of governance/administration and financial and human resources have been important determinants for the outcome of the program, so are community and stakeholders‚Äô participation standardization of training for community mental health professionals, IEC activities, the involvement of NGOs and private sectors, and a robust M and E mechanism. Though NMHP has given due consideration to these issues and many of these aspects have been incorporated in the on-going programme, its progress needs regular monitoring and mid-term correction, if required, for effective implementation. Overall, the current review shows that the NMHP has been a blend of achievements and failures.

Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar affective Disorder) Mood Disorder or Manic Depressive Psychosis    

Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.

There are three types of bipolar disorder. All three types involve clear changes in mood, energy, and activity levels. These moods range from periods of extremely ‚Äúup,‚Äù elated, irritable, or energized behavior (known as manic episodes) to very ‚Äúdown,‚Äù sad, indifferent, or hopeless periods (known as depressive episodes). Less severe manic periods are known as hypomanic episodes.

Manic Episode

A manic episode is a period of at least one week when a person is extremely high-spirited or irritable most of the day for most days, possesses more energy than usual, and experiences at least three of the following changes in behavior:

-Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feeling energetic despite significantly less -sleep than usual
-Increased or faster speech
-Uncontrollable racing thoughts or quickly changing ideas or topics when speaking
-Distractibility
-Increased activity (e.g., restlessness, working on several projects at once)
-Increased risky behavior (e.g., reckless driving, spending sprees)

Symptoms of a manic episode commonly require a person to receive hospital care to stay safe.

Depressive episode

A major depressive episode is a period of at least two weeks in which a person has at least five of the following symptoms (including at least one of the first two symptoms):

-Intense sadness or despair
-Loss of interest in activities the person once enjoyed
-Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
-Fatigue
-Increased or decreased sleep
-Increased or decreased appetite
-Restlessness (e.g., pacing) or slowed speech or movement
-Difficulty concentrating
-Frequent thoughts of death or suicide


Bipolar I Disorder‚Äî defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible.

Bipolar II Disorder‚Äî defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.

Cyclothymic Disorder (also called Cyclothymia)‚Äî defined by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.

People with bipolar I disorder frequently have other mental disorders such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The risk of suicide is significantly higher among people with bipolar I disorder than among the general population.

Treatment

Bipolar disorder symptoms commonly improve with treatment. Medication is the cornerstone of bipolar disorder treatment, though talk therapy (psychotherapy) can help many patients learn about their illness and adhere to medications, preventing future mood episodes.

Medications known as ‚Äúmood stabilizers‚Äù (e.g., lithium) are the most commonly prescribed type of medications for bipolar disorder. These medications are believed to correct imbalanced brain signaling. Because bipolar disorder is a chronic illness in which mood episodes typically recur, ongoing preventive treatment is recommended. Bipolar disorder treatment is individualized; people with bipolar disorder may need to try different medications before finding what works best for them.

In some cases, when medication and psychotherapy have not helped, an effective treatment known as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used. ECT involves several rounds of a brief electrical current applied to the scalp while the patient is under anesthesia, leading to a short, controlled seizure. ECT-induced seizures are believed to remodel brain signaling pathways.

Since bipolar disorder can cause serious disruptions in a person‚Äôs daily life and create a stressful family situation, family members may also benefit from professional resources, particularly mental health advocacy and support groups. From these sources, families can learn strategies for coping, participating actively in the treatment, and obtaining support.

World Health Day 2021 THEME - To build a fairer, healthier world

The objective of the World Health Day is to raise global awareness of a specific health theme and to highlight a priority area of concern for the World Health Organization (WHO). The celebration is marked by several activities to highlight, make aware, sensitize and focus on  important aspects of public health. 7th April of each year marks the celebration of World Health Day. From its inception at the First Health Assembly in 1948 and since taking effect in 1950, the celebration has aimed to create awareness of a specific health theme to highlight a priority area of concern for the World Health Organization.


Right to access healthcare services is about ensuring all people and communities have access to quality health services where and when they need them, without suffering financial hardship. It includes the full spectrum of services needed throughout life from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care and is best based on a strong primary health care system

Nobody should have to choose between getting life saving health services and feeding their family and no one should be put in a situation, where they have to choose between availing health services and feeding their family members 

Often the poorest are hardest hit those with little income to spare face a higher risk of disease and they are plunged further into poverty when paying for care 

Everyone, individuals, civil society groups, health professionals, researchers, policy-makers and media has a part to play in calling for, developing and delivering on policies to achieve affordable healthcare to all


Specific objectives of the World Health Day 2021 campaign were to:

- raise awareness of the inequality in healthcare access;
- provide information on how to access healthcare
- encourage self care to prevent illness;
- to make healthcare accruable, affordable to all;
- to incite national and local authorities to create enabling environments for healthy behaviors.

Assessment of Multiple Disability under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016  

Assessment of Multiple Disability under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act, 2016) is based on Guidelines on assessment of disability as per the RPWD Act, 2016 notified on 4 Jan 2018.  

India signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and subsequently ratified the same on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from an interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis.  

A person with disability ‚Äúmeans a person with long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with others‚Äù

In a notification released on January 4, 2018, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment provided guidelines for the certification of the various disabilities specified by the RPwD Act. This document outlines screening, assessment, and certification procedures. 

Any person applying for a certificate of disability must apply in form IV which is part of the Rights of Person with Disability Rules, 2017. The application may be made to the Medical Authority where the applicant was undergoing treatment in connection with his/her disability. The applicant can also apply to a Medical Authority which is notified as a competent authority to issue a certificate within the district where the applicant lives. When the person with disability is a minor or is suffering from an intellectual disability because of which he will not be able to make such an application, it must be made by the legal guardian or any organization registered under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, which is responsible for the minor applicant. The application form must be submitted along with a proof of residence, two recent passport size photographs and the applicant‚Äôs Aadhar card.

The term Multiple Disabilities covers a wide range of conditions, symptoms, severities and traits. These can be a combination of disabilities such as speech, physical mobility, learning, mental disabilities, visual, hearing, brain injury and more. There are 20 disabilities have been listed under the multiple disabilities section 40 of the guidelines. 

Some examples of multiple disabilities are as below.

Indian Disability Evaluation & Assessment Scale (IDEAS) for Mental illness under RPWD Act, 2016

Assessment of Mental (Psychiatry) Disability under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act, 2016) is based on Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) as per the RPWD Act, 2016. 

The term ‚Äúmental or psychiatric disability‚Äù is used when a psychiatric illness significantly interferes with the performance of major life activities such as self-care, working, moving and getting around, understanding, communication, interpersonal activities, and participation. Further, attitudinal and environmental barriers hinder full and active participation of Persons with mental illness  in the society on an equal basis. Mental illnesses continue to be underdiagnosed, undertreated, and underestimated in official statistics and discriminated against. This situation becomes worse with regard to providing care and social welfare measures to PMI in the low-and middle-income countries. Persons with mental illness face significant challenges during the assessment of disability due to the following reasons;

Psychiatric illnesses are often episodic, fluctuating, dynamic and debilitating. However, for the purpose of certification, mental disability should be assessed when the psychiatrist is satisfied that further psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation is not likely to reduce the extent of the impairment

India signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and subsequently ratified the same on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from an interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis.  

A person with disability ‚Äúmeans a person with long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with others‚Äù

Mental disability cannot be seen, hence it is often called ‚Äúinvisible disability‚Äù 

In a notification released on January 4, 2018, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment provided guidelines for the certification of the various disabilities specified by the RPwD Act. This document outlines screening, assessment, and certification procedures. The standardized tools to conduct the assessments have been specified and include the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (VSMS) for the assessment of adaptive functions and the Binet Kamat Test of Intelligence (BKT) or the Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) for the assessment of intellectual functioning. In the assessment of mental illness, a clinical assessment by a psychiatrist, rating with the Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS), and/or IQ assessment by a trained psychologist must be carried out.

The instrument is simple and comprehensive in quantifying mental illness disability. IDEAS was initially devised and advocated for four important psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, OCD, and dementia. However, as per the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, gazatted to use IDEAS to assesses disability on five dimensions: (‚ÄùSelf-Care,‚Äù ‚ÄúWork,‚Äù ‚ÄúInterpersonal Activities,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunication and Understanding,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDuration‚Äù) and to assess the disability for all mental disorders. Compared to IDEAS, administration of the WHO-DAS 2.0 requires more time, and training of the workforce to administer WHO-DAS 2.0 is more difficult. IDEAS have been found to be very useful in the field for assessing mental disability. Hence, IDEAS is more suited to the Indian setting. However, IDEAS has the following pitfalls such as:

a) It is not comprehensive
b) It does not cover all the mental disorders
c) Currently, it becomes difficult to compute the total duration of illness for episodic illnesses such as Bipolar Disorder and Depressive Disorder. 

 Persons with Mental Illness (PMI) are often stigmatized and discriminated, which hinders their full and active participation in society. This is a much larger issue, especially in women, gender minorities, backward communities, and the poor and the migrated populations. Adding to the complexities, PMIs are often not aware of their illness, refuse the much-needed treatment and often are not in a place to exercise their rights. There is an urgent need to address this issue of attitudinal barrier so that the rights of PMI are upheld.

Schizophrenia (Chronic Psychosis) Diagnosis, Treatment, Predictors of Course & Outcome

Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality, which causes significant distress for the individual, their family members, and friends. If left untreated, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be persistent and disabling. However, effective treatments are available. When delivered in a timely, coordinated, and sustained manner, treatment can help affected individuals to engage in school or work, achieve independence, and enjoy personal relationships. 

Two follow-up studies conducted by the World Health Organization, viz, International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia and Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders, showed that the outcome of schizophrenia is better in Indian population.  

Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects  0.3 to 0.7% of the Indian population. When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation. 

Schizophrenia is a syndrome with multifactorial etiology and unlike diseases (for example malaria, typhoid etc), it does not have a cure. The target of management is symptom resolution and prevention of relapse. Earlier the onset of intervention and shorter the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP); better the outcome

Schizophrenia is treatable and research is leading to innovative and safer treatments. Experts also are unraveling the causes of the disease by studying genetics, conducting behavioral research, and using advanced imaging to look at the brain‚Äôs structure and function. These approaches hold the promise of new, and more effective therapies.

Symptoms of schizophrenia usually first appear in early adulthood and must persist for at least six months for a diagnosis to be made. Men often experience initial symptoms in their late teens or early 20s while women tend to show first signs of the illness in their 20s and early 30s. More subtle signs may be present earlier, including troubled relationships, poor school performance and reduced motivation.

The symptoms of schizophrenia generally fall into the following three categories:

Psychotic symptoms

- include altered perceptions (e.g., changes in vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste), abnormal thinking, and odd behaviors. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality and experience themselves and the world in a distorted way. Specifically, individuals typically experience:

- Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that aren‚Äôt there

- Delusions, which are firmly held beliefs not supported by objective facts (e.g., paranoia - irrational fears that others are ‚Äúout to get you‚Äù or believing that the television, radio, or internet are broadcasting special messages that require some response)
- Thought disorder, which includes unusual thinking or disorganized speech


Negative symptoms 

- include loss of motivation, disinterest or lack of enjoyment in daily activities, social withdrawal, difficulty showing emotions, and difficulty functioning normally. Specifically, individuals typically have:

- Reduced motivation and difficulty planning, beginning, and sustaining activities

- Diminished feelings of pleasure in everyday life

- ‚ÄúFlat affect,‚Äù or reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone
- Reduced speaking

Cognitive symptoms 

- include problems in attention, concentration, and memory. For some individuals, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more prominent and interfere with activities like following conversations, learning new things, or remembering appointments. Specifically, individuals typically experience:

- Difficulty processing information to make decisions
- Problems using information immediately after learning it
- Trouble focusing or paying attention

Family members and other significant people can help by first taking the individual with these symptoms to a mental health professional, for psychiatric consultation, as early as possible rather than taking them to faith healers. Early diagnosis and starting treatment can improve the prognosis.

Examining a Person with Catatonia (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale) 

Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome in which the cluster of behavioral, psychomotor, affective and cognitive symptoms secondary to medical, neurological, psychiatric and idiopathic reasons. In DSM-5, catatonia is recognized as due to a medical or psychiatric condition, or unspecified, as, for example, in recurrent idiopathic catatonia. Mood disorders such as MDD and bipolar disorder are now recognized as more commonly associated with catatonia. These etiologies range from primary psychiatric disorders to general medical and neurological disorders, and drugs and substances of abuse.

The differential diagnosis of catatonia is extensive. Many conditions present with movement dysregulation and stupor. It is vital to perform a comprehensive medical examination and detailed neurological evaluation upon first contact with the patient. This should be accompanied by blood work, including a complete metabolic panel, blood count and analysis, electrolyte, kidney and liver function tests, a toxicology screen, as well as a battery of common hormonal values. A brain MRI and an electroencephalogram (to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus) are required. Some cases with fever or elevated neutrophil count will require examination of cerebrospinal fluid.

The common pathophysiology of catatonia entails a dysregulation of specific neural pathways affecting motor function and emotional regulation that relate to circuitry linking the medial frontal and inferior orbital cortices to the basal ganglia and thalami, with connections to the parietal lobes,
cerebellum, and limbic system. Thus, catatonia would be mediated by hypofunction of cortical (frontal) Gamma-aminobutyric Acid-A (GABA-A) neurotransmission, leading to hypoactivity of subcortical dopaminergic pathways in the basal ganglia, VMPFC, DLPRC and Orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, glutamate has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of catatonia, being a biological antagonist of GABA, and because glutamate
antagonists improve catatonia.

Differential diagnosis: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a medical emergency. It can lead to death if not treated. Patients with NMS typically present with fever, muscle rigidity and altered mental status. In some cases, akathisia, is sometimes seen rather that rigidity. Patients may develop delirium and mutism during the course of NMS and can appear much like cases of idiopathic catatonia. White blood cell count and CPK often increase in NMS and rhabdomyolysis is frequently seen. Hypertensive crisis and metabolic acidosis are common. Most patients will need the support of an intensive care unit to provide for adequate hydration, ventilation, and temperature regulation. Before doctor you try lorazepam challenge ascertain the functional nature by excluding all possible organic causes.  

Only in the presence of normal laboratory values (all investigations should have been done and organicity should have been ruled out), a lorazepam challenge test can provide a confirmatory diagnosis. Most cases of catatonia will respond to 2‚Äì4 mg of intravenous lorazepam. The injection will usually bring about normal motor activity and restore mental clarity within one to two min. This reduction in symptoms is brief, lasting 20‚Äì30 min before the patient gradually returns to a rigid stupor. 

The first order of care for the individual with catatonia is to establish the medical etiology. Along with the aggressively searching for the cause supportive treatment should be started immediately. The supportive care of the patient includes adequate hydration and other supportive measures. Concurrent care may include nutrition, cooling, prevention of aspiration, and consideration of thrombophlebitis prophylaxis. Once these measures have been taken, treatment of any underlying conditions should alleviate the psychomotor symptoms. This approach, however, does not manage all cases as catatonia may be idiopathic. Once medically stable, the active treatment usually falls into two categories, benzodiazepine activation or electroconvulsive therapy

Stigma and Discrimination associated with Mental illness (Mental Disorders) Psychiatric illness

Stigma is when someone sees you in a negative way because of your mental illness. Discrimination is when someone treats you in a negative way because of your mental illness. Social stigma and discrimination can make mental health problems worse and stop a person from getting the help they need. Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common.

Stigma can lead to discrimination. Discrimination may be obvious and direct, such as someone making a negative remark about your mental illness or your treatment. Or it may be unintentional or subtle, such as someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. You may even judge yourself.

Some of the harmful effects of stigma can include:

- Reluctance to seek help or treatment
- Lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others
- Fewer opportunities for work, school or social activities or trouble finding housing
- Bullying, physical violence or harassment
- Health insurance that doesn't adequately cover your mental illness treatment
- The belief that you'll never succeed at certain challenges or that you can't improve your situation

Get the mental health treatment you need. Try not to let the fear of being labelled with a mental illness stop you from getting help.

Do not believe it. Sometimes, if you hear or experience something often enough, you start to believe it yourself. Try not to let other people‚Äôs ignorance influence the way you feel about yourself. Mental illness is not a sign of weakness and is rarely something you can deal with on your own. Talking about your mental health issues with healthcare professionals will help you on your road to recovery or management.

Do not hide away. Many people with mental illness want to isolate themselves from the world. Reaching out to people you trust ‚Äì family, friends, coaches or religious leaders ‚Äì can mean you get the support you need.

Connect with others. Joining a mental health support group ‚Äì either online or in person ‚Äì can help you deal with feelings of isolation and make you realize that you are not alone in your feelings and experiences.

You are not your illness. Do not define yourself by your illness as other people might. Instead of saying ‚ÄòI'm schizophrenic‚Äô, say ‚ÄòI have schizophrenia‚Äô. There is power in language.

It‚Äôs not personal. Remember that other people‚Äôs judgements often come from a lack of understanding rather than anything else. These judgments are made before they get to know you, so do not believe that their views have anything to do with you personally.

Learning the facts about mental illness and sharing them with family, friends, work colleagues and classmates

Getting to know people with personal experiences of mental illness so you learn to see them for the person they are rather than their illness.

Not judging, label or discriminate when you meet people with mental illness. Treat all people with respect and dignity.

Avoiding using language that puts the illness first and the person second. Say ‚Äòa person with bipolar disorder‚Äô rather than ‚Äòthat person is bipolar‚Äô.

Coming out - Sharing your own experience of mental illness (if you have experienced it). This will help dispel myths and encourage others to do the same. Mental illness is not something shameful that needs to be hidden.

Counselling (Stages, Skills, Techniques, Assessment and Ethics in Counselling).

The act of helping the client to see things more clearly, possibly from a different view-point. This can enable the client to focus on feelings, experiences or behavior, with a goal of facilitating positive change. A relationship of trust. Confidentiality is paramount to successful counselling.

Counselling is empowering the client with adequate skills, knowledge and coping mechanisms to deal with his problems. In one sense, ‚Äúenabling‚Äù has the same meaning as ‚Äúempowering.‚Äù It means lending a hand to help people accomplish things they could not do by themselves. More recently, however, it has developed the specialized meaning of offering help that perpetuates rather than solves a problem.

Five steps of counselling are as follows:-

Step 1: Intake session
Step 2: Assessment
Step 3: Goal Setting
Step 4: Intervention.
Step 5: Weaning and Termination

Counselling Skills

1. Active listening by providing verbal or non-verbal awareness of the other person.  

2. Paraphrasing is when you summarize effectively what a person has just said.

3. Focusing encourages people to focus on the issues they are talking about rather than wander of topic.

4. Reflecting feelings, experiences or content that has been heard or perceived.

5. Interpreting by offering a tentative interpretation of the other‚Äôs feelings, desires or meanings.

6. Summarizing by bringing together in some way the feelings and experiences of the person talking.

7. Effective question skills are essential so that questions are asked in a supportive way that requests more information or helps the 
person‚Äôs attention to clarify on an experience or a feeling.

8. Giving feedback and sharing perceptions of the other‚Äôs person‚Äôs ideas or feelings.

9. Supporting by showing warmth and caring in one‚Äôs own individual way.

10. Allowing silence which gives people time to think as well as talk

Counselling is a skilled activity that involves assisting clients/group of individuals in managing and resolving psychological, emotional, behavioral, developmental, relational, vocational, and other personal challenges in order to facilitate adjustment to changing life circumstances; promote personal growth, needs attainment, and overall wellness throughout the life span; and prevent the development of more serious conditions.

Description of video 379:
Psychoeducation refers to the process of providing education and information to those seeking or receiving mental health services, such as people diagnosed with mental health conditions (or life-threatening/terminal illnesses) and their family members. Psychoeducation is an evidence-based therapeutic intervention for patients and their loved ones that provide information and support to better understand and cope with illness. Psychoeducation is most often associated with serious mental illness, including dementia, schizophrenia, clinical depression, anxiety disorders, psychotic illnesses, eating disorders, personality disorders, and autism, although the term has also been used for programs that address physical illnesses, such as cancer. 

Psychoeducation usually includes certain basic components of information, which are to be imparted to patients and their family members regarding a particular mental disorder. The modules may be modified to suit the needs of the patients, family members, clinicians, or vary according to a particular disorder. Thus, the number and timing of the sessions may vary along with alterations in the overall content.

According to the target population, psychoeducation can be an individual, family, group, or community-based. 

According to the predominant focus of psychoeducation, it can be compliance/adherence focused, illness focused, treatment-focused, and rehabilitation focused.

Active psychoeducation involves the active involvement of the therapist with the patient/family during the process, leading to interaction and clarification. In passive psychoeducation, materials are provided to patients/family members in the form of pamphlets, audio/video material that they are supposed to read and assimilate on their own. In a busy clinic with limited available time, a clinician may take resort to passive psychoeducation by distributing leaflets or educative materials about the illness written in a simple language, which the patient and guardians can easily understand and assimilate.

Psychoeducation offered to patients and family members teaches problem-solving and communication skills and provide education and resources in an empathetic and supportive environment.  Psychoeducation can take place in one-on-one discussion or in groups and by any qualified health professionals such as a psychiatrist, doctors, nurses, social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists, and physicians. In the groups, several patients are informed about their illnesses at once. Also, exchanges of experience between the concerned patients and mutual support play a role in the healing process.

Description of video 380:
Empathy in Healthcare and Mental Healthcare (Psychiatry) Evaluation. Empathy is an essential and critical skill in medical practice. Empathy is a critical component of communication that has attracted increasing attention in recent years especially in the healthcare    

Empathy is defined as, ‚Äúthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.‚Äù It is the capacity to put one‚Äôs self in another‚Äôs shoes and feel what that person is going through and share their emotions and feelings. It is the recognition and validation of a patient‚Äôs fear, anxiety, pain, and worry. It is the ability to understand patients‚Äô feelings and facilitate more accurate diagnoses and more caring treatment. 

There are different types of empathy that have been defined are cognitive, emotional and compassionate empathy. a) Cognitive empathy is basically being able to put yourself into someone else‚Äôs place, and see their perspective. b) Emotional empathy is when you quite literally feel the other person‚Äôs emotions alongside them, as if you had ‚Äòcaught‚Äô the emotions and c) Finally, compassionate empathy is what we usually understand by empathy: feeling someone‚Äôs pain, and taking action to help.

Emotional attunement operates by shaping what one imagines about another person's experience. In trying to imagine what the patient is going through, experiencing, and feeling physicians will sometimes find themselves resonating.  Expressing patient empathy indeed advances humanism in healthcare ‚Äì as a matter of fact ‚Äî expressing empathy in healthcare is the key friend to enhancing the patient experience and patient encounter.

Further, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that empathy directly enhances therapeutic efficacy. Engaged communication has been linked to decreasing patient anxiety. Empathy makes practicing medicine more meaningful. Many physician narratives attest to this. There is also some research supporting this claim, although there are alternative hypotheses that could explain the findings

Empathy extends far beyond a patient‚Äôs medical history, signs, and symptoms. It is more than a clinical diagnosis and treatment. Empathy encompasses a connection and an understanding that includes the mind, body, and soul.  Expressing empathy is highly effective and powerful, which builds patient trust, calms anxiety, and improves health outcomes. However, the barrier to empathy comes from the negative emotions that arise when there are tensions between patients' and physicians' relationship, in forensic cases and in malingering patients.  

Empathy is good for two important reasons, first, empathy is good for patients. It builds trust, which increases patient satisfaction and compliance. When patients perceive that they connect on common ground with the physician, they have better recovery rates. second, empathy is good for doctors and it decreases burnout in physicians

Interviewing in Psychiatry (Interviewing skills in mental healthcare settings) Psychiatric interview 

The purpose of a psychiatric interview is to establish a therapeutic relationship with the patient to collect, organize and formulate a differential diagnosis and treatment plan. A fundamental part of this interview is to establish rapport and foster a healthy healing therapeutic relationship.

History taking is the first step and interviewing skills are the most important tool to a psychiatrist. Given the nature of the discipline, most clinical diagnoses are made based on
the available information. Hence eliciting adequate information, analyzing and organizing it to reach a conclusion is a very important skill. 

To be able to elicit important information the interviewer needs to know certain specific skills
1. To be able to establish a rapport
2. Empathy and listening skills
3. Interview technique  

History taking is a Clinical interview, the focus of which is to obtain adequate information in order to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. There may be a lot of contextual information related to circumstances, events and psychosocial stressors which may be important to understand the person‚Äôs reaction and significance of the event but may not be relevant for clinical diagnosis. Hence the interviewer may need to filter these out. The interviewer should be non-judgmental and empathetic in approach to the interview. Certain questions may need to be asked in a specific set manner to elicit correct information and eliminate subjectivity in interview techniques and make the process of eliciting information reproducible. 

The clinician needs to be mindful of the sensitive nature of this interview and provide a safe environment for the patient to reveal such deeply personal information. The clinician needs to be mindful that patients may have disagreements with the clinician‚Äôs diagnosis and recommended treatments. Nothing in medicine is more stigmatized than mental health and substance misuse, hence mental health professionals need to be sensitive about this issue.

The nature of the psychiatric interview is getting the patient‚Äôs narrative. Facilitate the patient‚Äôs narrative with compassionate listening and reflection. Mindfulness and reflection is a form of mentoring through modeling for the patient.

Establishing rapport is probably the most important step in history taking. Especially when interviewing psychotic patients with poor insight, eliciting personal information like interpersonal issues, sexual history, sexual abuse etc. Introduce yourself and set the agenda of the interview by stating that you would be asking questions to understand the reason for consultation/admission.

Address the patient by name ‚Äì this is a user to gain the trust of the patient. Ensure confidentiality by making an explicit statement that information discussed with not be revealed without consent

Always interview the patient first and get her version of the history. This is also vital in cases where patients have poor insight and psychopathology involving the informants

Start with neutral questions such as occupation, education, family details, and so forth. Begin with open-ended questions such as ‚Äòwhat brings you to the hospital?‚Äô 

Note the presenting complaints with duration in chronological order

Elaborate on the chief complaints by directive questioning.

Use close-ended questions (Yes/No) for eliciting specific information and negative history

Use paraphrasing to make empathic statements

Follow the cues given by the patient and pick up leads for further questioning

Summarize at the end of the interview

Disability Concept, Definitions and Models. Explaining the definition & concept of Disability under UNCRPD and World Health Organization. 

India signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and subsequently ratified the same on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from an interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis.  

A person with disability ‚Äúmeans a person with long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairment which, in interaction with barriers, hinders his full and effective participation in society equally with others‚Äù

In a notification released on January 4, 2018, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment provided guidelines for the certification of the various disabilities specified by the RPwD Act. This document outlines screening, assessment, and certification procedures. The major changes include improved definitions and operationalized terms, increased focus on the rights of PwDs, measures to reduce discrimination, a movement toward an inclusive approach in education and work, the process of appointing a limited guardian, and the section on offences and penalties for contravening the rules. 

Disability is part of being human. Almost everyone will temporarily or permanently experience disability at some point in their life. Over one billion people ‚Äì about 15% of the global population ‚Äì live with some form of disability and this number is increasing.

Disability results from the interaction between individuals with a health condition such as cerebral palsy, down syndrome and depression as well as personal and environmental factors including negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social support.

People with disability experience poorer health outcomes, have less access to education and work opportunities, and are more likely to live in poverty than those without a disability. 

Very often people with disability do not receive the healthcare services they need. Evidence shows that half of people with disability cannot afford healthcare. People with disability are also more than twice as likely to find healthcare providers' skills inadequate.

Persons with Mental disability are often stigmatized and discriminated, which hinders their full and active participation in society. This is a much larger issue, especially in women, gender minorities, backward communities, and the poor and the migrated populations. Adding to the complexities, Persons with Mental disabilities are often not aware of their illness, refuse the much-needed treatment and often are not in a place to exercise their rights. There is an urgent need to address this issue of attitudinal barrier so that the rights of the disabled are upheld.

The Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016 (RPWD Act, 2016) of India 

Persons with Disability have been entitled with certain rights under the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016. This Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016 (RPWD Act, 2016) promotes and protects the rights and dignity of people with disabilities in various aspects of life ‚Äì educational, social, legal, economic, cultural and political. This Act is considered to be comprehensive and it aims to provide equal opportunities to persons with disabilities in India.  

India signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and subsequently ratified the same on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from an interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis. Further, the convention also mandates the signatories to change their national laws, to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers, and to comply with the terms of the UNCRPD. In this regard, the Government of India initially undertook the amendment of laws such as Persons with Disability Act, 1995 (PWD Act 1995). 

The Rights of Person with Disabilities Act, 2016 replaced the PWD Act 1995 to comply with the UNCRPD. The new act was fine-tuned considering the socio-cultural and local needs of the society, and the available resources. This act also recognizes medical authorities for assessment and certification of disability. Persons with Mental Illness (PMI) are often stigmatized and discriminated, which hinders their full and active participation in society. This is a much larger issue, especially in women, gender minorities, backward communities, and the poor and the migrated populations. Adding to the complexities, PMIs are often not aware of their illness, refuse the much-needed treatment and often are not in a place to exercise their rights. There is an urgent need to address this issue of attitudinal barrier so that the rights of PMI are upheld.

Some of the salient features of this The Rights of Person with Disabilities Act, 2016 are

1) According to the Act any person who ‚Äúintentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a person with a disability in any place within public view‚Äù is punishable with imprisonment.

2) To increase the job opportunities of persons with disabilities, the Act has increased the reservation quota from 3% to 4%. This means that 4% of all vacancies in the government organizations will be reserved for disabled people.

3) Another very important feature of this Act is the provision of special courts in each district. These special courts will handle cases pertaining to the violation of the rights of Persons with Disability.

4) A large number of children with disabilities do not get proper education in India. This act proposes that every child with disability gets free education from the age of 6 to 18.

5) State Governments will constitute district-level committees to address the local issues of Persons with Disability.

6) Office of Chief Commissioner and the Office of State Commissioners of Persons with Disabilities have been given more powers. Broad-based Central & State Advisory Boards on Disability are to be set up to serve as apex policy-making bodies at the Central and State level.

7) Number of types of disabilities have been increased from 7 to 21. 

8) Victims of acid attacks have been included in the list of Persons with Disability. Unfortunately, in India, acid attacks have been on the rise in last few years. Girls and women are often left severely disfigured/disabled due to such attacks.

9) Dwarfism and Muscular Dystrophy have also been included as separate categories of disability.

10) Three blood disorders, Thalassemia, Hemophilia and Sickle Cell disease, have been included in the list of disabilities.

Rights of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016 is a good beginning. But the rights of Disabled will be protected only if this Act will be implemented in its true spirit. Entire government machinery and the society at large will have to be sensitized towards the needs and equality of the disabled person. Equal opportunity for all can not be achieved only by passing a law. The entire society has to participate in creating such opportunities.

The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is important legislation that is indicative of a progressive nation. This is clearly indicated in the clause of Advance Directive under Mental Healthcare Act, 2017  

The enactment of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 by the current government is an attempt to protect the rights of the mentally ill and enable citizens to decide on the method of treatment in case of mental illness, lest they are mistreated or neglected. India ratified the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities in October 2007. The government to make appropriate changes by amending the mental health legislation of the country. Hence, a new Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 was drafted and notified to uphold the rights of the persons with mental illness   

The Act proposes an ‚Äòadvance medical directive‚Äô through which individuals can dictate how they ‚Äúwish to be" and ‚Äúwish not to be treated" and can nominate a member who can make decisions on their behalf should they lose their mental capacity. But it is unable to provide a clear procedure for preparing it. Advance directives empowers a mentally ill person to have the right to make an advance directive of how they would want to be treated for their requisite illness and who should be their nominated representative. This directive has to be vetted by a medical practitioner

Description of video 385:
Introduction to Mental Health and Mental Disorders

Mental Illness are classified in many ways based on the characteristics of the illness, severity, duration and the disability it causes to an individual. Mental disorders can affect women and men differently. 

What is Health?

As per the definition of health is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." Thus, for an individual to stay healthy, apart from physical health, mental well-being is equally important. It has been proposed by WHO ‚Äòthat there can be no physical health without mental health‚Äô.

Mental well-being of an individual implies that an individual is able to:

1. Realize his or her own potentials,
2. Cope with the normal stresses of life,
3. Work productively and fruitfully, and
4. Make a contribution to her or his community.

Few major components influencing the mental health include,

‚Ä¢ Resilience: Life poses various short- and long-term challenges. Dealing with them effectively and not getting overwhelmed by them is crucial for mental health. Various life skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and stress tolerance can help us in this. 

‚Ä¢ Self-esteem: Self-esteem refers to our perception towards ourselves; for example, in our own evaluation how valuable we are to others and how confident we are in our own abilities. Positive self-esteem helps us in realization of our potentials and having a sense of control.

‚Ä¢ Emotional well-being: Regulations of emotions in constructive manner and dealing with emotional upheavals so that they do not affect us negatively are important for our emotional well-being.

‚Ä¢ Spiritual well-being: It refers to having sense of purpose in life and our connectedness with others. Spirituality does not mean religiosity but religious beliefs can be one of the means for our spiritual well-being. Apart from this, sharing, helping etc. boosts our spiritual well-being.

‚Ä¢ Social connectedness: Last but not least, having a wider perspective towards society, respect for others and acceptance of other‚Äôs beliefs and values are important for positive mental health.

Bio-psycho-social cause of mental illness

Patients / caregivers/ general public will often ask you the reasons for development of mental illnesses. It is very important to make them understand that in contrary to the popular belief, mental illnesses are not the result of possession by evil spirits, curses, astrological influences, character weakness, laziness, karma or black magic. There are many factors that play a vital role in the onset and course of the mental illnesses. 

Most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factors including: stressful life events, biological factors, individual psychological factors (e.g. poor self-esteem, negative thinking), adverse life experiences during childhood (e.g. abuse, neglect, death of parents or other traumatic experiences), social factors like poverty, migration, access to health and sanitation etc.

Factors affecting mental health

Mental illnesses are often caused by a combination of biological, psychological and social factors. It is important to identify the contributing risk factors at various levels and also the protective factors which can be leveraged upon for patient care. 

A brief description is as follows: Most mental health disorders are caused by a combination of factors including,

‚Ä¢ Stressful life events

‚Ä¢ Biological factors

‚Ä¢ Individual psychological factors e.g. poor self-esteem, negative thinking

‚Ä¢ Adverse life experiences during childhood e.g. abuse, neglect, death of parents or other traumatic experiences.

Some people may be more vulnerable to mental health disorders than others but may not develop an illness until they are exposed to stressful life events.

- Biological factors can include genetics, brain injury, and chemical imbalance in the brain. 

- Stressful life events can contribute to the development of mental health disorders . A lot of stress may also contribute to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain.

- Poverty can place a person at risk of mental health disorders because of the stresses associated with low levels of education, poor housing and low income. Mental health disorders are also more difficult to cope with in conditions of poverty.

- Difficulties in childhood such as sexual or physical violence, emotional neglect, or early death of a parent can sometimes lead to a mental health disorder later in life.

The Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA) 2017 has come up with some major changes in the mental healthcare by introducing the concept of advance directives and nominated representatives and aims at strengthening the human rights of person with mental illness (PMI) and clearly emphasized the responsibility of the government. The objective of this article is to give a brief overview of the admission and discharge of patients under MHCA, 2017. 

Any person, who is incapable to make mental health care and treatment decisions independently and needs very high support in the mental health establishment. Admission and treatment of persons with mental illness with high support needs in mental health establishment up to thirty days (supported admission under sec 89) and beyond thirty days (supported admission under sec 90) under Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The medical officer or mental health professional in charge of a mental health establishment shall admit every such person to the establishment, upon application by the nominated representative of the person, under sec 89 and 90. 

The person has been independently examined on the day of admission or in the preceding seven days, by one psychiatrist and the other being a mental health professional (under sec 89). Two psychiatrist need to examine independently examined on the day of admission or in the preceding seven days (under sec 90).     

Mental Healthcare Act 2017 mandates that proper discharge planning should be done and documented before any discharge is done from MHEs. Discharge planning should be based on a thorough assessment of the needs of the patient. Family should be actively involved in the planning process. Necessary steps should be taken for referral to other services, especially those in the community. Discharge planning helps us to balance the goals of the treatment at admission, to reality check at the time of discharge.

Description of video 387:
The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 is landmark legislation in India and the first step towards ensuring a ‚ÄòRight to Access to Mental Healthcare‚Äô law in the near future. It consists of important provisions that empower a persons with mental illness in India based on different parameters;

A). Rights of the MIP are respected; The act gives the persons with mental illness an advance directive of forming a will and nominating a relative or well-wisher to act on behalf of the patient when the patient him/herself is incapable to do so. The act also gives the MIP the right to confidentiality of medical records, right to information about illness and treatment and protection from any discrimination whatsoever.

B). Provision of various services: The act requires that the Govt. to make rehabilitation homes, sanatoriums, care homes and other group therapy associations for persons with mental illness. The govt. will also have to ensure that medical professionals are trained as per world class standards within 10 years of passing the law. Awareness programmes pertaining to medical and familial care of persons with mental illness, prevention of mental illnesses and suicide prevention methods too will have to be promoted by the govt. to ensure that the general populace is aware of the issue at hand.

However. the new act is heavily influenced by the western model of mental healthcare. It is based on a rights framework, and gives the individual total autonomy over themselves. This means that I may be suffering but refuse to get treated because the law allows me to do so.

There is no health without mental health. Recently conducted National Mental Health Survey quoted prevalence of 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% current mental morbidity. To address this mammoth problem, an aspirational law was enacted titled ‚ÄúMental Healthcare Act, 2017‚Äù (MHCA 2017). The act is progressive and rights-based in nature. The preamble of MHCA 2017 promises to provide mental healthcare and services for persons with mental illness (PMI) and to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of such persons during the delivery of mental healthcare and services. The whole dedicated Chapter 5 on ‚ÄúRights of the person with mental illness‚Äù is the heart and soul of this legislation. The heart and soul of this legislation are in Chapter 5 which safeguards the patients' right to access a range of mental healthcare facilities (such as inpatient and outpatient services; rehabilitation services in the hospital, community, and home; halfway homes; sheltered accommodation; and supported accommodation). If the services are not available, PMI is entitled to compensation from the state. Right to community living, right to confidentiality, right to access medical records, right to protection from cruelty and inhumane treatment and right to equality and nondiscrimination are all ensured by the law. The act seeks to ensure that mental healthcare facilities are available to all. Those below the poverty line, whether in possession of BPL (below poverty line) card or not, the destitute, and the homeless will be entitled to free mental health treatment. The act provides the right to confidentiality and protection from cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, in addition to the right to live in a community and avail free legal aid. It bans electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without anesthesia and any type of ECT to children and restricts psychosurgery. The need of the hour is a law that can be implemented in practice and can cater to the health needs at all levels of prevention (primary, secondary, and tertiary) while also protecting the rights of the family, professionals, and end-users.

A Mental State Examination (MSE) is a part of every mental health assessment. Interpretation of the MSE must keep in mind the patient‚Äôs age and developmental level. The MSE is used to gain an understanding of the patient‚Äôs psychological functioning during a period of time. MSE needs to be intuitively done every time clinician interact with or observes the child

Mental status in children and adolescents may have a higher intensity and frequency variation than adults. For instance, depressive disorders in young people have preserved reactivity such that a depressed child may appear reasonably excited when given a toy to play with during examination. Serial examinations are more useful in getting a true picture about the mental state characteristics. Children and adolescents may also not be ready to immediately share their experiences, feelings, and thoughts. This may happen because of unfamiliarity and intimidation by the clinical setting, or a developmental unreadiness. The clinician must not make presumptions about the capacity of children to give information/participate in an interview. Children as young as 2‚Äì3 years old can answer simple questions about what they like, who they like, what makes them angry, etc. The clinician must make it a point address the child and ask questions in an age appropriate language.


Expecting and waiting for preschool children to cooperate across an interview table may not be successful, whereas letting the child sift through toys, or be in a play area may reveal his activity levels, attention span, ability to tolerate frustration, and cognitive abilities. Use of colors, pens, paper, puzzles, peg boards, can all be used in the office to facilitate interaction with young children. Direct questions to a child should be short, precise, in simple words, dealing with one concrete issue at a time. For example, if a child is being bullied at school, asking him/her ‚ÄúDoes anyone trouble you at school?‚Äù would be better than asking, ‚ÄúCan you tell me about any problems you are facing at school?‚Äù Children are able to relate to, and identify with cartoon characters and animals better than they are able to talk about their own feelings and behaviors. Talking to them using these familiar themes may facilitate disclosure about their emotions, and experiences. Children may be intimidated by the clinical setting, and uncomfortable with direct questions. Use of paper and line diagrams, with both the clinician and the child looking at the paper and talking may be better than direct eye to eye contact.


The development of formal operational thinking in adolescents puts them in a position to be able to not only report their experiences, but also draw interpretations and hypotheses. It is important to interview the adolescent alone, since a developing self-awareness and self-consciousness may make them feel inhibited in front of family. Adolescents are also very concerned about not being believed, or being considered weak or different. They often put a lot of time and energy into ‚Äúnormalizing‚Äù their experiences, or denying them. The clinician must therefore make all attempts to make the adolescent feel comfortable and acknowledge their subjectivities. Confidentiality can be a big issue, especially in the context of substance use or sexuality. The clinician must avoid false promises of confidentiality just to get the adolescent to open up. Adolescents appreciate logical arguments and find comfort in predictability. It is, therefore, advisable for the clinician to be honest about the limits of confidentiality.

Temperament refers to patterns of emotional and behavioral reactivity to environmental situations and capacity for self-regulation. It is essentially a reflection of social and emotional development in a child. Temperamental traits described by Thomas and Chess are useful to generate a comprehensive picture of a child's temperament.

The parents may have to be reminded during an interview to give information on the child's behavioral tendencies prior to the occurrence of current behavioral concerns. Parents‚Äô information on different temperamental traits in a child should be corroborated with examples of the child's behavior in different circumstances. This is important as sometimes parents judge a child's behavior based on their own personality characteristics.

Description of video 392:
Detailed clinical assessment of children and adolescents must evolve from a biopsychosocial perspective, taking into account these inextricably interlinked aspects. Clinical history taking and interviewing are one of the most powerful tools available (in the absence of any laboratory investigations) to the child and adolescent mental health professional to make a diagnosis and plan management.  

The central goal of a detailed clinical assessment is to come to a case formulation that would guide management decisions. Delineating signs and symptoms through detailed clinical history and examination help ascertain key areas of concern and presence (or absence) of a mental health disorder. To adequately comprehend the origins, maintenance, and factors affecting remission from the disorder, it is essential to place the child within a psychosocial background, relate the presentation to his/her unique context, and to gather details about what has happened to the illness so far, including what has been the treatment and response history. On the face of it, these components appear factual.

The clinician must be sensitive to the child's lived experience, family environment, and culture as well as their developmental and cognitive capabilities. Clinical judgment and expertise are required to assimilate the information obtained from the child and other key informants. In child and adolescent mental health, multidisciplinary inputs are required for almost every child and family and efforts must be made to link the different arms of evaluation and treatment such that there is convergence. 

Confidentiality and the limits thereof must be discussed with the child and family. Documentation is a very important aspect of assessment and must be strictly maintained. A comprehensive clinical assessment goes a long way in ensuring interventions in the best interest of the child and family.

Description of video 393:
History and interviewing the children and adolescents are not watertight compartments. Observation of the child/adolescent has to start soon as he/she first meets the clinician (from entry to exit from the clinic). Mental states in children and adolescents may have a higher intensity and frequency variation than in adults. For instance, depressive disorders in young people have preserved reactivity such that a depressed child may appear reasonably excited when given a toy to play with during examination. Serial examinations are more useful in getting a true picture of mental state characteristics. 

Children and adolescents may also not be ready to immediately share their experiences, feelings, and thoughts. This may happen because of unfamiliarity and intimidation by the clinical setting or developmental unreadiness. The clinician must not make presumptions about the capacity of children to give information/participate in an interview. Children as young as 2‚Äì3 years old can answer simple questions about what they like, who they like, what makes them angry, etc. The clinician must make it a point to address the child and ask questions in age-appropriate language.

Expressive channels evolve from play in very young children to art and other creative methods, and finally to verbal dialogue in adolescents. The manner of exploration and engagement with children must follow this understanding. Therefore, waiting for preschool children to cooperate across an interview table may not be successful, whereas letting the child sift through toys, or be in a play area may reveal his activity levels, attention span, ability to tolerate frustration and cognitive abilities. Use colors, pens, paper, puzzles, pegboards, can all be used in the office to facilitate interaction with young children. Direct questions to a child should be short, precise, in simple words, dealing with one concrete issue at a time. For example, if a child is being bullied at school, asking him/her ‚Äù Does anyone trouble you at school?‚Äù would be better than asking, ‚ÄúCan you tell me about any problems you are facing at school?‚Äù shall be appropriate

Observing infants and toddlers can uncover a range of behavioral and developmental facets. Using play techniques, especially with toddlers, can clarify cognitive, linguistic, social, and motor developmental achievements. The child has to be in a calm, alert state for the best estimation of cognitive and socio-emotional development. Therefore, if the child is irritable, from hunger or some physical discomfort, the parents may be asked to attend to the immediate needs of the child and then resume the assessment process.

The physical health status of the child could give important clues to the possibility of underlying medical conditions as also under-stimulation and parent-child attachment. Height/length, weight, state of skin and hair, and the activity levels ‚Äì curiosity, interest in the environment ‚Äì can be easily observed during the first few minutes of the assessment.

Evaluation in child and adolescent psychiatry is layered and complex. Clinical impressions may change from the first contact to the next. It is useful to go over in detail the clinical history at least a few times. The ‚Äúdetailed work-up pro forma‚Äù systematically records information on all aspects of a child's life. As parents answer questions pertaining to different domains they too get clarity on the multi-factorial contributors to the child's difficulties.

Screening of Child and Adolescent in Psychiatry (Screening for mental health issues in Children and Adolescent population). 



Screening children and adolescents for mental health issues or mental illness is challenging for any mental health professionals. Generally, the child/adolescent in question or the parent would not have initiated the consultation or may not be in agreement with the need for a consultation. The referral would have been from the school or legal agency. Children may be able to report the nature of symptoms with difficulty, they may not be very good at reporting the timing, chronological event, and duration of their problems. They may not report problems if the insight is poor. There are bound to be discrepancies in the report; nevertheless, multi-source information is a requirement during diagnosis and management.  




Screening is a brief assessment to know a) any organicity / serious medical issues b) safety of the child is in question c) Immediate IP Care is required because of the issue of danger to self (suicide) or others (harm to others) d) OP basis management can be planned & e) planing for detailed evaluation in a later date. This video focuses on the Screening of Child and Adolescent in Psychiatry on an outpatient basis

Assessment of Mood in Mental Status Examination (Examination of Mood Disorders). Mood is a patient‚Äôs subjective description of how they are feeling over a period of time. It is determined by directly asking the patient to describe how they are feeling in their own words in the past one month. It is documented as a verbatim report of the patient.

Cross-sectional observation by the practitioner of expression through their non-verbal language depicts the objective assessment of mood/affect. Terms often used are euthymic, happy, sad, irritated, angry, agitated, restricted, blunted, flat, broad, bizarre, full, labile, anxious, bright, elated, euphoric.[6] In addition to these terms, the range of affect may be described. For example, a patient may be minimally irritated versus extremely agitated. Some practitioners will also specify whether the affect is appropriate to the situation. A patient who is smiling and laughing after being brought into the hospital for involuntary evaluation is considered to have an inappropriately elated affect. Another descriptor clinicians may use to describe affect is whether the affect is congruent or incongruent to the thought process. 

To summarise -

Subjective mood: Ask ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow has been your mood for most periods of the day over the last one month‚Äù ‚Äì give verbatim description given by the patient.

Affect: Cross-sectional observation of facial emotional expression, motor behavior, gestures, posture, speech
(Euphoric/irritable/depressed/anxious/perplexed/restricted/blunted or flat).

 Range: intact/restricted

 Reactivity: preserved/absent

 Lability: (rapid shifts of mood during an interview) present/absent

 Appropriateness to situation and congruency to though the process

Assessment of Speech under Mental Status Examination (Disorders of Speech) - Speech is evaluated passively throughout the psychiatric interview.  It is of key importance to do a speech assessment before you proceed to complete MSE. Speech assessment should be done in the patient's mother tongue or the language in which the patient is comfortable. If the patient speaks less than normal, they may be experiencing depression or anxiety. Conversely, an increased/hyperverbal amount of speech may also indicate some level of anxiety or that a patient is currently manic. Fluency refers to the patient‚Äôs language skills. The rate of speech may be slow in depressed patients or those with a neurocognitive disorder. The pressured rate may indicate acute substance intoxication or that the patient is experiencing a manic episode. A delayed speech response time may also indicate a neurocognitive disorder or that the patient is experiencing a thought process disorder such as thought blocking seen in psychosis. The rhythm of speech can provide clues to a number of diagnoses. Slurred speech may indicate intoxication. Dysarthria may indicate a possible motor dysfunction when speaking. Volume can be quiet if a patient is depressed/withdrawn or loud if they are agitated. Lastly, the tone may indicate a patient‚Äôs mood. 

To summarise- 

Coherence or not 

Relevance or not 

Tone (loudness) of speech ‚Äì normal/increased/decreased

Tempo (rate or speed) of talking ‚Äì normal/increased/pressure of speech/decreased

Volume (amount) of speech. Estimate words per minute ‚Äì verbose/pressure of speech/decreased

Prosody ‚Äì emotional intonations of speech

A thought disorder (TD) is any disturbance in cognition that adversely affects language and thought content, and thereby communication. A variety of thought disorders were said to be characteristic of people with psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia. 

There are four types of thought disorders ‚Äì Form, Stream, Possession, and Content.

1. Form: Obtain a speech sample on a neutral topic. Assess for the poverty of thought/poverty of thought content/ circumstantiality/flight of ideas/tangentiality/loosening of associations and derailment/neologisms

2. Stream: Observe for flow and continuity of thought process ‚Äì Flight of ideas / prolixity / retardation / perseveration / thought block

3. Possession: Disorders of thought related to the ownership of thought

Obsessions ‚Äì describe if thoughts are repetitive/intrusive /irrational/ego-dystonic/person‚Äôs own thoughts. Also mention the form (ideas/ impulses/ images/ doubts/ruminations) and content of obsessions. Compulsions are motor/cognitive acts to decrease the anxiety of obsessions.

Thought broadcast ‚Äì thought diffusion/thinking in unison /audible thoughts/Thought insertion/Thought withdrawal

4. Delusions ‚Äì Give verbatim description given by the patient and then give your impression whether the belief is - Fixed/firm/false/not in keeping with socio-cultural background/morbid origin. Describe content of belief (persecutory/ referential/misinterpretation/grandiose/ hypochondriacal/ etc). If there are multiple delusions also describe whether they are - Single/multiple elaborate/non-elaborate, bizarre/non-bizarre systematized/non-systematized

- Overvalued ideas

- Depressive cognitions ‚Äì hopelessness/worthlessness/helplessness

- Death wishes or suicidal ideation ‚Äì Describe the frequency, the intensity of ideas and

Disorders of Perception (Assessment of Hallucinations) Different types of hallucinations. Perception is the process of becoming aware of what is presented through sensory organs. Disorders of perceptions can be classified into disorders of Distortions and disorders of Deception. 

Disorders of deceptions are illusions, hallucinations, and pseudo-hallucinations. Hallucinations refer to perception without any obvious stimulus of the sensory organs, and these cannot be distinguished from reality. Illusions are misinterpretations of stimuli. Pseudo-hallucinations are sensory deceptions but considered by the person as subjective, not substantial, lacks clarity, not so vivid, and felt unreal unlike "true" hallucinations, which are considered real by patients.

In simple words, pseudo-hallucinations are subjective perceptions similar to hallucinations, with respect to their character but that differ from those because these do not have objective space reality, not so clear and vivid and presences of insight.

Description of video 399:
Initial psychiatric assessment of the uncooperative patient can often be quite challenging. It is difficult to fully assess an uncooperative patient. The complete psychiatric evaluation usually cannot be completed until the patient is calm enough to participate in a psychiatric interview. In the absence of any laboratory-based test for diagnosis, an uncooperative patient challenges any health care provider. Nonetheless, emergency clinicians must perform their duty of providing care as soon as the agitated patient presents to an emergency setting. For this reason, the psychiatric evaluation of an uncooperative patient becomes valuable for the same. In this regard Kirby‚Äôs proforma plays an important role in providing a semi-structured format in the assessment of uncooperative patients. The focus of the evaluation is on developing a reasonable differential diagnosis, ascertaining safety and self-care concerns, and deciding how to manage the agitation.

Psychiatric evaluation of the agitated patient includes visual observation of the patient before the direct patient interview and paying careful attention to the patient's verbal and nonverbal interaction with the examiner during de-escalation. Collateral information can be very helpful. While de-escalation is in process, another team member can obtain verbal reports from family, paramedics, or police officers or review written material that may accompany the patient.

Mental Status Examination in a clinical setting (MSE in clinical psychiatry) plays an important role in the diagnosis and management.  

A mental status examination is an essential tool that aids physicians in making psychiatric diagnoses. It is analogous to the physical exam in general medicine. it is a series of observations and examinations at one point in time.  The mental status examination includes a historic report from the patient and observational data gathered by the physician throughout the patient encounter. Major challenges include incorporating key components of the mental status examination into a routine office visit and determining when a more detailed examination or referral is necessary. 

Although our observations occur in the context of an interview and may therefore be ordered differently for each patient, the report of our findings is ordered and "paints a picture" of a patient's appearance, thinking, emotion and cognition. The data from the Mental Status Exam, combined with personal and family histories and Psychiatric Review of Systems, form the data base from which psychiatric diagnoses are formed.

The mental status examination can help distinguish between mood disorders, thought disorders, and cognitive impairment, and it can guide appropriate diagnostic testing and referral to a psychiatrist or other mental health professional.

Clinical Assessment of Cognitive Function in Psychiatry (Bedside Clinical Cognitive Assessment). The History taking, Mental Status Examination (MSE) and Cognitive function assessments are the most important diagnostic tools in Psychiatry or mental disorders. These tools are essential to make an accurate diagnosis because there are no laboratory investigations available for diagnosing mental illness or psychiatric disorders. The components of case/history taking are described in the following video. The material presented here is intended to enable students and mental health professionals to follow a uniform method of case taking in psychiatry.   

It is impractical to examine everything in the cognitive function assessment, and as in most other areas of psychiatric disorders, the history remains pre-eminent in guiding subsequent cognitive functional examination. The central role of an informant, good history taking, keen observation, bedside assessment and the ability to immediately test hypotheses generated during the history taking, distinguish this means of cognitive function assessment and assists in making an accurate diagnosis.

Prescribing Medicines on Telemedicine Consult (Online prescription legal requirement).

The most significant limitation imposed by Telemedicine Practice Guidelines on the practice of telemedicine in India is online prescription. Going forward, doctors will not be able to prescribe medicines over teleconsultation freely.  In order to prevent abuse, the Telemedicine Guidelines require every doctor to ‚Äúprescribe medicines via telemedicine ONLY when (the doctor) is satisfied that he/ she has gathered adequate and relevant information about the patient‚Äôs medical condition and prescribed medicines are in the best interest of the patient.‚Äù Prescribing Medicines without an appropriate diagnosis/provisional diagnosis will amount to professional misconduct. If the teleconsultation with the patient does not take place over the video, then the concerned doctor cannot prescribe drugs to the patient other than common over-the-counter (‚ÄúO.T.C.‚Äù) medications such as paracetamol, O.R.S. solutions, cough lozenges etc. The doctor may, however, prescribe ‚Äòadd-on‚Äô medication to such patients to optimize the existing treatment through drugs if such existing treatment was prescribed in an in-person consultation less than six months ago. Please note that there is no bar in prescribing emergency medications, even if they are not O.T.C. medicines, as and when notified by the government, through any form of teleconsultation, whether video or not.

The guideline also clearly says, under what circumstances - List A and List B can be prescribed.

List C - is completely prohibited for online consultation.

Legal Issues to be kept in mind before starting telemedicine practice in India.  Doctors using telemedicine shall uphold the same professional, clinical, ethical norms, standards, and laws as applicable to a traditional in-person consultation. If the RMP has prescribed medicines, RMP shall issue a prescription as per the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations and shall not contravene the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules.


The Board of Governors in supersession of Medical Council of India will soon make way for the National Medical Commission. However, this transition will not impact the Telemedicine Guidelines and the practice of telemedicine in India. The National Medical Commission Act, 2019 has a savings clause, which will allow the Code of Conduct and Telemedicine Guidelines to survive and remain enforceable until new regulations are made

Patient identification is mandatory during all consultations: All doctors should confirm the patient‚Äôs identity to his/her satisfaction by asking patient‚Äôs name or age or address or email I.D. or phone number or any other identification that may be reasonable. Doctor also needs to introduce himself with name, designation and registration number. A doctor who provides teleconsultation is required to display his/her registration number provided by respective State Medical Council on his/her prescription, website, electronic communications (WhatsApp/Message/Email etc.) and fee receipts given to his/her patients.

Caregiver identity and authorization should be checked: If the patient is not a minor or is not incapacitated, then a caregiver cannot consult on behalf of the patient unless he or she has a formal authorization such as a signed authority letter by the patient or his/her legal representatives (family members) or, where the caregiver is a family member himself or herself, if he or she has a document that verifies his or her relationship with the patient such as a government identity proof. The caregiver‚Äôs identity and authorization should be checked by the doctor before offering teleconsultation. In the case of minors, the identity of the caregiver should be confirmed.

Doctor should maintain patient records of teleconsultation, patient‚Äôs personal data should not be disclosed or transferred without the written consent of the patient, doctor should not deny emergency teleconsultation, but limit it for immediate assistance or first aid and refer the patient for in-person consultation, diagnosis is mandatory before prescribing any medicine online and also training on telemedicine.

Telemedicine Triage (Tele-triage) Telemedicine Practice Guidelines Triage 2020. Also well-known as ‚Äútele-triage,‚Äù the arrangement helps diagnose and direct noncritical cases to the next step in a person‚Äôs care journey. Triaging is applied in disaster situations and emergency health care settings to prioritize the services to the needy. Tele-triaging will help us reach out to more people and ration the resources to those that need them the most.  Tele-triaging would help the doctors to make an informed decision about whether a patient requires community care, in-person care, tertiary care or can be effectively managed through telemedicine. A hub-and-spoke model that can efficiently leverage remote healthcare worker to provide the first line of consultation and to assess the patient, who require higher center care. This triage allows specialist doctors to focus more on critical cases.

She overcame mental illness under Ramon Magsaysay Award-winner Dr Bharat Vatwani's care, only to find out that the influential Bollywood director who has been fostering the baby won't let go of the child. A toddler has become the centre of a custody feud between his biological mother, recovering from mental illness, wanting him back and his influential foster family, who took him back after being ordered to give him up. While doctors treating the mother are worried that she will slip into depression without the child, the foster parent, a well-known Bollywood director, after taking good care of the child, has become emotionally invested. But what is in the child's best interest? These questions and the possibility of a court case are looming before the two parties and related stakeholders.

Please do give your valuable comments below ................ who should get the custody of the child? Foster parents or Biological Parents?

Telemedicine Practice Guidelines was notified on 25 March 2020. These guidelines finally clarify India‚Äôs position on the legality of teleconsultation. It is now legal to provide teleconsultation by a doctor to a patient residing in any part of India in line with the requirements of the Telemedicine Guidelines. In fact, the Telemedicine Guidelines specifically permit Doctors to provide teleconsultation for prescribing medicines, providing counseling, and imparting health education. A doctor may use any digital mode (text/audio/video) for patient consultation, e.g. telephone, mobile or landline phones, chat platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc., other mobile apps or internet-based digital platforms for telemedicine or data transmission systems like Skype/ email/ fax, etc. Telemedicine Practice Guidelines do not ban social media for consultation. This was a strategic move by the Indian government to reach the last person in a remote village to provide care. The user-friendly ecosystem and widespread use of social media have necessitated this move to reach the public at large.


The notification of the Telemedicine Guidelines marks the dawn of a new era in the practice of modern medicine. The law has finally caught up with the reality and necessity of modern times. 
The Telemedicine Guidelines enable doctors to confidently provide teleconsultation via any medium (such as email, phone call, message, fax, WhatsApp, other mobile and computer applications such as Skype, Google Hangouts etc.) to the patients. At the same time, they protect patient interest by mandating doctors to identify themselves before consultations, disclose their registration number, offer the same standard of care to patients as during in-person consultation and limit medicines that can be prescribed through teleconsultation. Indians will now be able to enjoy access to quality healthcare remotely, and doctors will be able to extend their services to many more needy patients.

Emergency Telemedicine Consultation - Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020.

In all telemedicine consultations, as per the judgment of the RMP, if it is an emergency situation, the goal and objective should be to provide in-person care at the soonest. However critical steps could be life-saving and guidance and counseling could be critical. For example, in cases involving trauma, right advice and guidance around maintaining the neck position might protect the spine in some cases. The guidelines are designed to provide a balanced approach in such conditions. The RMP, based on his/ her professional discretion may

o Advise first aid
o Counseling
o Facilitate referral

In all cases of emergency, the patient MUST be advised for in-person interaction with a Registered Medical Practitioner at the earliest

Description of video 414:
Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020 of India clearly defines Follow-up consult on telemedicine. Follow-Up Consult(s) means - the patient is consulting with the same RMP within 6 months of his/her previous in-person consultation and this is for the continuation of care of the same health condition. However, it will not be considered a follow up if: a) there are new symptoms that are not in the spectrum of the same health condition; and/or b) the doctor does not recall the context of previous treatment and advice. This definition is simple and clear to operationalize. Prescribing medicines online during follow-up consult has been explained clearly without any ambiguity   

The guidelines enable doctors to utilize audio, video, text, apps, email, social media, fax, or any other available communication platform to interact with other RMPS, health workers, patients, and their caregivers. This reduces the ambiguity and entitles RMPs to explore innovative digital options to reach the stakeholders. For service users, telemedicine provides better access to care, minimize travel-related expenditure, and safety from contagious diseases. The guidelines allow both initial and follow-up consultations through telemedicine services.

Telemedicine Practice Guidelines of India explains the first consult very precisely and crisp. First Consult means - The patient is consulting with the doctor for the first time; or The patient has consulted with the doctor earlier, but more than 6 months have lapsed since the previous consultation; or The patient has consulted with the doctor earlier, but for a different health condition 

Board of Governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India released the Telemedicine practice guidelines for doctor on March 25, 2020. The guidelines enable the RMPs to deliver health care using technology. The purpose of the guidelines is to offer clear, practical advice to the RMPs about using technological advancements in medical practice. The guideline is an important first step in organizing the telehealth services across the nation. Scope, definitions, norms, protocols, and framework to implement telemedicine services are outlined in this guide. The roles and responsibilities of patients, RMPs, health workers, and telehealth platforms while administering telemedicine services are clearly delineated.

Description of video 417:
Many mental health professionals have a poor understanding of their role in a disaster response team. They are neither part of a pre-existing or post-disaster response team. They have to play a multi-dimensional role from educating, training, negotiating, administrative, fundraising, collaborative, skill transferring, treating, advocating and rehabilitating. 

In addressing the spectrum of problems during post-disaster, mental health clinics in relief camps are useful in identifying and treating moderate-to-severe cases only. Hence, the role of a specialist as a clinician is very minimal. However, the specialist has a very important role in training local resources in simple community-based interventions. These include art therapy; informal education; group discussions; drama; structuring of daily activities; engaging in activities such as yoga, meditation, prayers, relaxation, sports, and games; spiritual activities; providing factual information; educating parents and teachers. They were intended to provide important components of psychosocial rehabilitation such as normalizing, stabilizing, socializing, defusing of emotions and feelings, and restoration of a sense of identification with others and of safety and security.  Disaster management needs to follow the principle of democracy. That is ‚Äòof the people, by the people and for the people‚Äô for disaster assistance to be acceptable, accessible, adaptable, and adaptable for long-term community participation and empowerment

Description of video 419:
Disaster mental health is based on the principles of ‚Äòpreventive medicine‚Äô This principle has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach of health promotion, disaster prevention, preparedness, and mitigation. This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be understood on the basis of six ‚ÄòR‚Äôs such as Readiness (Preparedness), Response (Immediate action), Relief (Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial measures using community resources), Recovery (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering). Prevalence of mental health problems in the disaster-affected population is found to be higher by two to three times than that of the general population. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbors a large number of sub-syndromal symptoms. The majority of the acute phase reactions and disorders are self-limiting, whereas long-term phase disorders require assistance from mental health professionals. Role of psychotropic medication is very limited in preventing mental health morbidity. The role of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in mitigating mental health morbidity appears to be promising. The role of Psychological First Aid (PFA) and debriefing is not well-established. Disaster management is a continuous and integrated cyclical process of planning, organizing, coordinating, and implementing measures to prevent and to manage disasters effectively. Thus, now it is time to integrate public health principles into disaster mental health.

Stress and Resilience are the two faces of a coin. The animal needs to become resilient for handling stress. Workplace stress can influence healthcare professionals‚Äô physical and emotional well-being by curbing their efficiency and having a negative impact on their overall quality of life and also indirectly affects the outcome of the patients. Being exposed to stress like pandemic for too long, may lower a healthcare workers' efficiency, effectiveness and could trigger negative consequences on everyone in touch with healthcare workers. In general, healthcare professionals are more prone to stress and professional burn-out, because they are responsible for human lives and their actions or lack of action can have a serious impact on their patient and further litigation can be traumatic to any healthcare professionals.  

Stress management is a wide spectrum of techniques & therapies aimed at controlling a person's level of stress, especially chronic stress, usually for the purpose of and for the motive of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or distress in the terminology advocated by Hans Selye, rather than what he calls eustress, a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise

Compassion fatigue is the stress that comes from caring and emotionally engaging with patients can strike any healthcare worker if there is a negative outcome of the diseases. Because they care so deeply about their patients, healthcare professionals who listen to stories of fear, pain, and suffering can find themselves empathetically experiencing similar emotions.

International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction - Disaster Risk Governance 2020. This year‚Äôs International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction is all about governance. You can measure good disaster risk governance in lives saved, reduced numbers of disaster-affected people, and reduced economic losses. COVID-19 emergency clearly indicated that we need a clear vision, plans and competent, empowered institutions acting on scientific evidence for the public good. This requires having national and local strategies for disaster risk reduction in place by the end of the year as agreed by UN Member States when they adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015. We need to see strategies that address not just single hazards like floods and storms, but those that respond to systemic risk generated by zoonotic diseases, climate shocks and environmental breakdown.

Good national and local strategies for disaster risk reduction must be multi-sectoral, linking policies in areas such as land use, building codes, public health, education, agriculture, environmental protection, energy, water resources, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation.

he Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA) was a step that was essential, once the Government of India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. The MHCA looks to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of persons with mental illness (PMI) as stated in the preamble of the Act. Further, there is an onus on the state to provide affordable mental health care to its citizens. In India, mental health has always been a lesser priority for lawmakers and citizens alike. The rights-based MHCA looks to overhaul the existing system by giving prominence to autonomy, protecting the rights of the mentally ill individuals, and making the State responsible for the care. The decision to make all this happen is commendable. 

The Government has shown its political will by notifying the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. However, the poor public awareness, stigma, discrimination, non-availability of continuous medications, and access to mental health care in certain places pose a big challenge for providing mental healthcare for all.

This is an imaginative project yet to be comprehensively conceptualized to see the light of the day. Suicide rates are increasing steadily across the globe. There is an urgent need to have a comprehensive plan to address this issue. In this regard, an editorial was published in IJMR 2019 titled - "Suicide in India: A preventable epidemic" Indian J Med Res. 2019 Oct; 150(4): 324‚Äì327  [Available online at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902368/]  


Suicide prevention programs can be organized at three different levels

(i) National Level (addresses the entire population irrespective of the level of risk of the individuals in the population), 

(ii) Community Level (address at-risk groups with the goal of preventing the onset of suicidal behaviour), and 

(iii) Individual Level. Based on a similar strategy, we propose a model that could be adopted to our Indian setting. 

A suicidal person may not ask for help, but a suicidal attempt is a desperate call for help to escape unbearable pain that the person can see no other option than completing it. Most suicidal individuals give warning signs or signals of their intentions. The best way to prevent suicide is to recognize these warning signs and knowing how to respond to such a crisis situation. There should be a coordinated multi-dimensional, multi-agency, multi-phase, and multi-departmental approach to bring this epidemic under control. This is not just a health issue, but a social issue, and it is everyone's duty to save life. Everyone can save a life, and it is time to act before it is too late.

Irresponsible reporting of suicide by Media has repeatedly been shown to trigger suicidal behaviour. A study done by AIIMS, New Delhi on Indian Media reporting of suicide and adherence to WHO guidelines.  The title of the study was "the quality of online media reporting of celebrity suicide in India and its association with subsequent online suicide-related search behaviour among the general population: An infodemiology study" by Prof Rajesh Sagar and his colleagues was published in Asian Journal of Psychiatry. Quality of media reporting of a celebrity suicide on online media in India is poor when compared to adherence with the WHO guidelines. In terms of potentially harmful media reportage, 85.5% of them violated at least one WHO media reporting guideline, with use of sensational language and mention of suicide site being the most common ones.

In terms of potentially helpful media reportage, 13% provided information about where to seek help for suicidal thoughts or ideation, and only 2% included a mental health expert opinion while reporting suicide. The study concluded that there is an urgent need for taking steps to improve the quality of media reporting of suicide in India.

Media reporting of suicide is a double-edged sword, with inappropriate and sensational reporting of suicide news leading to a copycat phenomenon or Werther effect or contagious suicide. Whereas, sensible media reporting of suicide along with media involvement in spreading preventive information shown to minimize copycat eÔ¨Äects, and has been shown to be eÔ¨Äective in reducing suicide deaths (Cheng et al., 2018).

We all experience stress differently in different situations. Sometimes you might be able to tell right away when you're feeling under stress, but other times you might keep going without recognising the signs. Stress can affect you both emotionally and physically, and it can affect the way you behave. Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not realize it. You may think illness is to blame for that irritating headache, your frequent insomnia or your decreased productivity at work. But stress may actually be the cause. Indeed, stress symptoms can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior. Being able to recognize common stress symptoms can help you manage them. Stress that's left unchecked can contribute to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes. This video educates the viewer on identifying signs and symptoms of stress

Media reporting of Suicide has a direct effect on the public at large. There is substantial scientific evidence demonstrating that the way suicide deaths are reported in the media can impact rates of suicidal behavior in the community (Stack, 2003; Etzersdorfer et al., 2004; Stack, 2005; Pirkis et al., 2006; Pirkis et al., 2007; Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2010; Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2012). Research findings suggesting certain ways of describing suicides in the news media contributed to this 'Werther effect", ‚Äúsuicide contagion‚Äù or ‚Äúcopycat suicide‚Äù have underpinned efforts by health professionals to impose guidelines on the reporting of suicide. 



The Press Council of India chaired by Justice C.K. Prasad, in a release dated September 13, 2019, has adopted guidelines on reporting on suicides, based on the WHO guidelines. It states that newspaper and news agencies while reporting the cases of suicide:


1. Must NOT Place stories about suicide prominently and unduly repeat such stories
2. Must NOT use language which sensationalizes or normalizes suicide or presents it as a constructive solution to problems
3. Must NOT Explicitly describe the method used
4. Must NOT Provide details about the site/location
5. Must NOT Use sensational headlines
6. Must NOT Use photographs, video footage, or social media links.


Overcoming challenges in implementing the Press Council's guidelines requires active collaboration between media personnel and mental health professionals. Further, a monitoring mechanism has to be initiated to ensure that the guidelines are followed.


The guidelines on media reporting of suicide are likely to have a greater impact if they are embedded in a broader national strategy to prevent suicides.

A suicide prevention strategy for a population of 136 crore population is a huge challenge. A community-led peer support initiative, for suicide prevention in India, is going to be the key to success in preventing death by suicide.  The majority of the young people experiencing suicidal thoughts or engaging in self-harm do not seek professional help, they do seek help from informal sources of support in their social networks. Therefore, up-skilling the people that regularly come into contact with young people in the community, such as teachers, school personnel or peers is a focus of many suicide-prevention strategies. Suicide prevention strategy should be local empowerment through task shifting and sharing, making awareness,  increasing help-seeking and reducing suicidal behaviours in young people.

Myths and Facts of Suicide play a crucial role in the help-seeking behavior of the citizens. Some of the commonly held misconceptions about suicide or attempted suicide may stop citizens from recognizing when someone is at risk of taking their own life. Many people may think that suicide attempter just seeks attention or being manipulative to get their way. They are week minded. On the contrary, when someone talks about committing suicide, they‚Äôre usually saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not coping right now‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need some help‚Äù or ' Desperate cry for help'. If someone is talking about suicide and self-harm, it should be taken seriously. Listen to their distress and suffering, so that you understand what is happening in their life. Debunking the common myths associated with suicide can help society realize the importance of helping others seek treatment and show individuals the importance of addressing their mental health challenges.

India reported an average of 381 deaths by suicide daily in 2019, totaling 1,39,123 fatalities over the year, according to the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. A 3.4 per cent increase was observed in suicides during 2019 (1,39,123 suicides) as compared to 2018 (1,34,516) and 2017 (1,29,887), the data showed. For every 100 suicide deaths, 70% were male and 30% females, the NCRB, which collects data from police recorded cases, stated.

Suicide by ''hanging'' (53.6 percent), "consuming poison'' (25.8 percent), '' drowning'' (5.2 percent), and ''self-immolation'' (3.8 percent) were the prominent means of committing suicides in India. 

The view that suicide cannot be prevented is commonly held even among health professionals. Many beliefs may explain this negative attitude. Suicide is a multifaceted problem and hence suicide prevention programmes should also be multidimensional. Collaboration, coordination, cooperation and commitment are needed to develop and implement a national plan, which is cost-effective, appropriate and relevant to the needs of the community. Psychiatrist needs to adopt proactive and leadership roles in suicide prevention and save the lives of thousands of young Indians. Lets Pledge to Save Lives

Understanding the Physiology of Stress is crucial to deal with it. The body's response to stress is to promote cell homeostasis. A stress response causes physiologic and behavioral changes that include various systems such as nervous, endocrine, and immune. Physiologic responses to stress are carried out through several pathways such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the behavioral fight or flight response. Increased cortico-steroid secretion and adrenaline changes the static phenomenon into massive dynamic defense system to fight against the threat / stress. This phenomenon needs to be understood to bring the system under control, sometime rebooting may require.

Certification of Transgender Identity: An application for certification of identity can be made under Sec 5 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. A transgender person may make an application to the District Magistrate for issuing a certificate of identity as a transgender person. The role of a medical fraternity has been removed for gender identification.

Certification of Gender: Along with the identification certificate and medical certificate issued by the Medical Superintendent or Chief Medical Officer of the medical institution in which that person has undergone sex reassignment surgery can apply the District Magistrate for the certificate of gender change and first name change in all official documents including birth certificate under Sec 7 of the TPA, 2019. The Act also mentions that such change in gender (with or without surgery) should not affect the rights and entitlements of the transgender


The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 is silent regarding the standard of care and process of certification for hormonal therapy and sex reassignment surgery. This standard care can be drafted under the rules and provisions have been made under the sec 15(d) of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019

Description of video 445:
The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 legislation prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in educational institutions, government offices, during the renting or purchasing of property, or while seeking healthcare and using public services. The disparity in access to health care for the sexual minorities exists in all societies. Their access to health care needs to be ensured because they are at a high-risk for various physical illnesses, mental illnesses and suicide rate and suicidal tendencies among transgender persons are considerably high compared to the general population. 

The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act,  2019 casts obligation on the appropriate Government under Sec 15 to proactively to make healthcare needs in relation to transgender persons; (a) to set up separate human immunodeficiency virus Sero-surveillance Centres to conduct sero-surveillance for such persons in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National AIDS Control Organisation in this behalf; (b) to provide for medical care facility including sex reassignment surgery and hormonal therapy; (c) before and after sex reassignment surgery and hormonal therapy counselling; (d) bring out a Health Manual related to sex reassignment surgery in accordance with the World Profession Association for Transgender Health guidelines; (e) review of medical curriculum and research for doctors to address their specific health issues; (f) to facilitate access to transgender persons in hospitals and other healthcare institutions and centres and (g) provision for coverage of medical expenses by a comprehensive insurance scheme for Sex Reassignment Surgery, hormonal therapy, laser therapy or any other health issues of transgender persons.     

Transgender Protection Act, 2019 is silent about the following burning issues such as the marriage of transgender persons, adoption of the child by transgender persons, right to social security and pensions. The legislation makes half-hearted attempts to provide rights to transgender. There are no proactive measures have been taken to ensure the economic, social and cultural rights of the transgender. These rights include a scholarship for transgender students, reservations in the education sector and employment, the right to access healthcare services, right to pension makes a difference in their life and few steps towards mainstreaming them.  

Transgender Protection Act, 2019 legislation is also silent about the budgetary provisions to make the rights available to every transgender person. Although the legislation facilitates access to transgender persons in hospitals but does not promise ‚Äòright to reasonable healthcare‚Äô for transgender persons. This indicates that the TPA, 2019 does not proactively discuss the Hormonal therapy and SRS has a right. The TPA, 2019 does not classify or determine, what constitute SRS? Further, the Transgender Protection Act, 2019 under Sec 7, mandates SRS for ‚Äògender‚Äô  change certificate and will be certified by the district magistrate. This issue violates the ‚Äòright to self-determination‚Äô, which is a basic reason and tenant of this legislation.     

Although there have been protests regarding the quantum of punishment approved under the law. TPA, 2019 can be read along with the Indian Penal Code because Sec 20 of TPA, 2019 dictates that the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in force. However, still, the dilemma remains that if a trans-male or trans-female was forced to have penetrative sex against their consent, how will this be read under IPC sec 375. The Indian Penal code on Rape in India presently is still gender-specific. It only recognizes rape and sexual assault where the victim is defined as a ‚Äòwoman'. On the other hand, TPA, 2019 dictates only a maximum of two years imprisonment for sexual abuse.  

The transgender community has been facing discrimination for the simple reason that their behaviours, views, beliefs, roles or way of life do not accord with the ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô. Healthcare sector is the one, which usually does not discriminate.  There is an urgent need for allocation of research funding, education of health care workers, and implementation of existing non-discrimination policies in all healthcare service establishments

A landmark judgment by India‚Äôs highest court has overturned a colonial-era law that criminalizes consensual gay sex, in a hard-fought victory for the LGBTQ community.

The five-judge bench reached a unanimous decision and delivered its decision that the LGBTQ community has the same fundamental rights as citizens. The identity of a person is very important and we have to vanquish prejudice, embrace inclusion, and ensure equal rights.

In fact, the first challenge to the law was taken by the Naz Foundation, a NGO that works to create awareness of HIVS/AIDS and other sexual health issues. In 2001, they filed a petition challenging the law in the Delhi High Court. Later, a series of cases and judicial pronouncement ensured their rights in Independent India.

New Delhi‚Äôs High Court decriminalized homosexuality among consenting adults in 2009, only to be later overturned by the country‚Äôs Supreme Court in 2012, following appeals from various so-called straight groups from all religious group. 

In 2016, again petitions were filed in the Supreme Court by prominent LGBT activists. The petitioners claimed that Section 377 violated their sexual autonomy, privacy, and right to equality. This video will highlight the LGBT struggle to gain their rights

The new Consumer Protection Act, 2019 had raised lot of speculation and confusion, whether the medical services come under the purview of new legislation?  Whilst the matter is still under deliberation, several claims were made from within the medical profession, that it has been excluded from the legislation but legal luminaries opine to the contrary. The CPA 2019 in its current form does not explicitly specify healthcare in the list of services listed in the definition of 'service', even though the earlier version of the consumer protection bill as passed by the Lok Sabha had included it. An amendment was recently introduced in the Parliament to remove healthcare from the list of services ("Healthcare Amendment") following stiff opposition from the medical fraternity which expressed apprehension that the CPA 2019 would be misused against them. Due to the last minute changes in the legislation in the definition of services withe regard to Healthcare, it is unclear whether healthcare as a service is included in the ambit of the CPA 2019. On the one hand, the Government has reportedly stated that the Healthcare Amendment will not exempt healthcare services from the purview of the CPA 2019

This video brings in both the argument and counter argument regarding the inclusion vs exclusion of healthcare services from the ambit of the new law. Further, this video also explains the significant differences between the new legislation CPA, 2019 vs COPRA, 1986

The New Act has widened the definition of 'consumer'. The definition now includes any person who buys any goods, whether through offline or online transactions, electronic means, teleshopping, direct selling or multi-level marketing.  The doctor-patient relationship took a ‚Äúcontractual‚Äù form after the judgment passed in the Indian Medical Association v. V P Shantha case in 1995. From this judgment, we came to understand that the medical profession too was a form of service that came under the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 1986.  Some of the significant changes include pecuniary jurisdiction, the introduction of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, new provisions for litigation, the introduction of regulators such as the Central Consumer Protection Authority and the institution of telemarketing. The district forum can now entertain consumer complaints where the value of goods or services paid does not exceed INR one crore. The State Commission can entertain disputes where such value exceeds INR ten Crore, and the National Commission can exercise jurisdiction where such value exceeds INR ten crore. The New Act provides flexibility to the consumer to file complaints with the jurisdictional consumer forum located at the place of residence or work of the consumer. The New Act also contains enabling provisions for consumers to file complaints electronically and for hearing and/or examining parties through video-conferencing. This video looks at these provisions, addresses their merits and demerits especially from a medical practitioner's perspective, and discusses its implications on medical practice in India.

The Doctors have indeed been on edge since 20th July 2020, after the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 came into force. While the Consumer Protection Act, has indeed been a horror-instilling phenomenon in the litigation fearing medicos, the new amendments indeed have brought a new sense of panic with its various features including enhancement of penalty powers with the lower fora and lack of judicial and medical experts involved in place when dealing with the specialized medico-legal cases.


Even the old Consumer Protect Act,1886 passed by the Parliament did not envisage to include the medical profession. The medical profession was only brought under the purview of the Consumer Protection Act in 1994 following a Supreme Court verdict in the V.P.Shanta Vs Indian Medical Association case. Ever since doctors and hospitals came under the purview, there has been a tremendous rise in medical negligence cases. Over the years, the amount of compensation has also seen a steep upward trend, with forums asking doctors and hospitals to pay compensation commonly in the denominations of crores to the extent of 12 crore rs. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 does not clearly express whether doctors come under the ambit or not? This video discusses this issue in detail

Homeless persons with mental illness (HPMI) suffer indignities due to shirking of all obligations by the society. In addition, the HPMI is denied all rights available to citizens, such as confidentiality, privacy, safety, right to practice religion, health, and the right to not suffer from inhuman treatment. In this context, the new Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA), 2017 has brought in a list of rights for HPMI, and this is a welcome sign. The MHCA has also taken away the mandated involvement of judiciary to provide care for the HPMI. 

Every officer in-charge of a police station shall have a duty to take under protection any person found wandering at large within the limits of the police station whom the officer has reason to believe has mental illness and is incapable of taking care of himself. Police shall take the PWMI to the
nearest public health establishment as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four hours from the time of being taken into protection, for assessment of the person‚Äôs healthcare needs. 



This is a welcome move and simplifies the process of providing care for the HPMI by preventing untoward delays. However, on the other hand, ground realities in terms of the systems and the existent infrastructure are far from satisfactory. Further work needs to involve all stakeholders to realize the true spirit of the Act. Apart from the speedy and strict implementation of its provisions, public‚Äìprivate partnerships are another way forward. There is an urgent need to invest in community facilities such as halfway homes, daycare centers, home again facilities, and clustered group homes

Prohibited procedures (Section 95)

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) without muscle relaxants and anesthesia
ECT for minors. In cases where ECT is necessary, consent by guardian and approval by the board should be received beforehand.


Note: ECT cannot be given if a patient with capacity refuses it. The consent of the NR is required only if the patient has no capacity. Patients can refuse ECT with a valid AD. ECT cannot be administered to such patients when they lose capacity even if the NR consents to it. The medical officer would need to approach the MHRB to review the AD.


Psychosurgery (Section 96)

According to WHO-Resource Book, psychosurgery is under prohibited procedures. MHCA 2017 still allows the procedure if and when required, but needs written informed consent from the patient and approval from the board before the surgery.

Physical restraint (Section 97)

This may be used when it is the only means to prevent harm, after authorization by a psychiatrist for the minimum period possible. It should never be used as a punishment

Note: Seclusion is prohibited. Seclusion for short periods could be useful in deescalating a potentially aggressive situation. Low-stimulus areas could be particularly useful. However, this could also be interpreted as seclusion.

The prevalence of suicides has been increasing in recent years. The number of persons who attempt to die by suicide is 20 times that of the number of those who die by suicide every year as per the World Health Organisation. Indian Government passed the Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA), 2017. Section 115 of the act tried to decriminalize the attempt to die by suicide, thereby encouraging the help-seeking behavior of the survivors and also remove the legal barrier in providing services. This has legal implications with regard to abetment laws of Sections  116, 306, and 309 of Indian Penal Code. Regarding mental healthcare delivery, this act enables the person who attempted to die by suicide, to access free healthcare, treatment, and rehabilitation.

All admissions in the mental health establishment shall, as far as possible, be independent admissions.  

Any person, who is not a minor and who considers himself to have a mental illness and desires to be admitted to any mental health establishment for treatment may request the medical officer or mental health professional in charge of the establishment to be admitted as an independent patient.

Emergency Treatment of Persons with Mental Illness (Sec 94) as per Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 dictates that any medical treatment, including treatment for mental illness, may be provided by any registered medical practitioner to a person with mental illness either at a health establishment or in the community, subject to the informed consent of the nominated representative, where the nominated representative is available, and where it is immediately necessary to prevent‚Äî
(a) death or irreversible harm to the health of the person; or (b) the person inflicting serious harm to himself or to others; or (c) the person causing serious damage to property belonging to himself or to others where such behaviour is believed to flow directly from the person‚Äôs mental illness.

Nothing in this section shall allow any medical officer or psychiatrist to use electroconvulsive therapy as a form of treatment. The emergency treatment referred to in this section shall be limited to seventy-two hours or till the person with mental illness has been assessed at a mental health establishment, whichever is earlier

A person with mental illness shall have the right to confidentiality in respect of his mental health, mental healthcare, treatment and physical healthcare. All health professionals providing care or treatment to a person with mental illness shall have a duty to keep all such information confidential which has been obtained during care or treatment.  No photograph or any other information relating to a person with mental illness undergoing treatment at a mental health establishment shall be released to the media without the consent of the person with mental illness. The right to confidentiality of person with mental illness shall also apply to all information stored in electronic or digital format in real or virtual space

Advance directives are documents stating treatment preferences in case of future lack of decision making capacity. MHCA 2017 legislation revolves around ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù and gives every person the right to make an advance directive. This is a written statement which explains ‚Äúhow they want to be cared‚Äù and ‚Äúhow they should not be cared for‚Äù in case they become incapacitated because of the mental illness. Further, the person (except minors) can also choose a NR to assist him/her with treatment-related decisions. In India, as in many other countries, legislators advocate Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs), while evidence on its use is limited.

MHCA 2017 is heavily influenced by the western model of legislation. It is based on individual rights, is patient centric, and gives the individual total autonomy over them, which comes in the way of the treatment unless the patient gives informed consent. On a closer look, this act is premised on a hypothesis that the mental healthcare providers and family members are the main violators of the rights of the PMI

The heart and soul of this legislation are in Chapter 5 which safeguards the patients' right to access a range of mental healthcare facilities (such as inpatient and outpatient services; rehabilitation services in the hospital, community, and home; halfway homes; sheltered accommodation; and supported accommodation). If the services are not available, PMI are entitled to compensation from the state. Right to community living, right to confidentiality, right to access medical records, right to protection from cruelty and inhumane treatment, and right to equality and nondiscrimination are all ensured by the law. The act seeks to ensure that mental healthcare facilities are available to all.


Implementation of AD and NR in India can be a challenging issue with respect to current availability of human resources and also socioeconomic constraints. Other challenges are multiple revocations of AD and NR and the supremacy of MHRBs in decisions related to challenging AD and NR. These issues may result in difficulties to provide care by other stakeholders such as family, nongovernmental organizations, and mental health professionals. The above situations may result in disharmony between patient and family. Ultimately, the family may disown the patient, and this may have serious consequences in the form of abandoning of the patient who may end up as wandering mentally ill, and all this would defeat the very purpose of the act in protecting the patient. We need to consider the fact that the family members are the true value and assets in the Indian context. Hence, the family members should be the natural guardians until proven otherwise. AD and NRs break the very backbone and fabric of our society, ‚Äúthe family.‚Äù The clause on NR may need amendment in consideration with the Indian society.

Capacity to Consent - Mental capacity refers to the ability of an individual to make one's own decisions. Decision-making capacity has been described as the ‚Äúkey to autonomy‚Äù and an important ingredient of informed consent. Limited or impaired mental capacity embarks on a minefield of ethical and legal issues, which doctors need to be aware of while dealing with a particular patient.

Persons with mental illness may have to take treatment (as prophylaxis to avoid relapse) for many years even after improving from the illness. Now, the main issue arises is how much leverage needs to be given on, ‚Äúright to autonomy‚Äù (mental capacity) with regard to consent for the treatment or admission versus keeping the ‚Äúlarger interest of the society‚Äù from dangerousness of the persons with mental illness if he refuses treatment and relapses. There should be some balance between the ‚Äúindividual rights‚Äù (autonomy) versus the ‚Äúsafety of the society‚Äù (larger interest of the society). In developed countries, right to autonomy has been coupled with the casting of obligation with compulsory community treatment order on patients, who is refusing to take much-needed treatment (prophylaxis) while in the community. In India, the family plays an important role in providing care for persons with mental illness and the community care order will be a boon providing an additional tool for the care giver. The inclusion of compulsory community treatment orders may play a significant role in providing care for the chronically ill patients and also better lives of the family members and care givers while in the community. Hence, there is a need to have a place for community treatment orders in the legislative process.

There are issues related to capacity to make decisions related to mental healthcare and treatment, and this may have serious consequences because. Section 4 of MHCA 2017, capacity to make mental health care and treatment decisions, is flawed and can have dangerous consequences. In a nutshell, this section dictates capacity in relation to the ability of the patient to (a) comprehend the information or (b) assess risk or (c) communicate his/her decision. If he/she has any one of the above components, a PMI can refuse treatment. That means a psychiatrist will only be able to provide treatment for the minority of the PMI, with difficulty. Hence, there is an urgent need for clarification and for a guidance document to be released for the assessment of the mental capacity, and amendments need to occur for the Section 4. The Section 4 needs to be amended by deleting ‚Äúor‚Äù and introducing ‚Äúand‚Äù between 4 a, b, and c 

A PMI may refuse treatment due to (a) absent insight, (b) severe symptoms, or (c) his/her symptoms coming in the way of decision-making. Family members usually find it difficult to manage individuals with serious mental illness who have no insight, and usually, such patients refuse admission and treatment. Chapter 2, Section 4, by default, considers everyone to have capacity, and before initiating involuntary treatment, one has to prove that a PMI lacks capacity. In such context, act gives a provision to treat the patients through a valid advance directive (AD) or in its absence, a NR. Where there is no AD or NR appointed by a person, the law assumes relative or caregiver as NR for the admission and treatment-related decision.


MHCA of 2017 focuses mainly on the human rights of PMI. It is prudent for the lawmaker to account for the culture of the land, newer scientific developments in the mental health field, analyze the met-unmet needs of the patients and families, and make provisions to bridge the treatment gap. There is also a need to make provisions to enhance the resources and skill building among professionals/workers in the field of mental health, to provide comprehensive healthcare services, to promote mental health and well-being, and to make provisions for adequate financial support/budget (for plan and nonplan expenditures).

There is no health without mental health. Recently conducted National Mental Health Survey in India reported a prevalence of 13.7% lifetime and 10.6% current mental morbidity. To address this mammoth problem, an aspirational law was enacted titled ‚ÄúMental Healthcare Act, 2017‚Äù (MHCA 2017) in the parliament. The MHCA 2017 promises to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of persons with mental illness (PMI) as stated in the preamble of the legislation. Further, there is an onus on the State to provide affordable mental health care to its citizens. The rights-based MHCA 2017 looks to change this scenario by overhauling the existing system by giving prominence to autonomy, protecting the rights of the mentally ill individuals, and making the State responsible for the care. 
Mental health has received a lower priority in India and also in the background of Covid-19, fulfilling the obligation of the legislation is a big challenge and difficult to implement. MHCA 2017 grants a legally binding right to mental healthcare to over 1.3 billion people, one-sixth of the planet's population. Political will always be questionable especially in healthcare. But, Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi himself, brought out a vision of digital India, MHCA 2017, and Telemedicine Practice Guidelines-2020 encouraging for tapping the full potential of telehealthcare for India and showing the way for the global healthcare. In order to be accountable, transparent, responsive and fulfill the obligation under the MHCA, 2017, Department of Health, Government of Karnataka initiated a digital innovation exercise titled ‚ÄòMental Health Management System‚Äô (e-MANAS; the term manas in vernacular means ‚Äòmind‚Äô) in collaboration with Tele Medicine Centre, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, and Electronic Health Research Centre, International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru, India. Information technology (IT) centric solutions can ensure that legislation and policy decision taken by the government can be quickly executed and implemented at multiple locations, across the length and breadth of the country. This article focuses on the IT innovation of the ‚ÄòMental Health Management System‚Äô (e-MANAS) aiming to implement MHCA 2017 and keeping the COVID-19 challenge in the forefront.

‚ÄùRight to access mental healthcare‚Äù 

Section 18 of the Act articulates that ‚Äúevery person shall‚Äù have a right to access mental health care and treatment from mental health services run or funded by the appropriate government, and the government shall make sufficient provision as may be necessary, for a range of services required by PMI. If the government fails to provide the right to access mental health care to everyone, then it is the responsibility of the government to reimburse the costs of treatment according to section 18, 5 (f) of the MHCA 2017. Section 18 is for ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù because a person who is on prophylaxis (on follow-up and do not meet the criteria of PMI) can access mental health-care services and free essential medicines; a person who does not meet the criteria of PMI (had an illness but improved currently) can access a range of rehabilitation services, and another person can seek help before he/she develops mental illness (prevention and promotion). It is very important to note that only Section 18 of the MHCA, 2017 says every person has the right to access mental health care and beyond doubt, it applies to everyone. However, Section 19‚Äì28 applies only for PMI.

Justiciability of right to access to mental health care

The Act has taken a paradigm shift of providing ‚Äúmental healthcare‚Äù as a ‚Äújusticiable rights.‚Äù Justiciability refers to the amenability of an issue to be adjudicated on in the judicial or quasi-judicial statutory bodies under the legislation. This right is meant to ensure that services be accessible, affordable, and of good quality. It also mandates the provision of mental health services to be established and available in every district of the country. Now, all States are legally bound to provide this right to their citizens under the MHCA, 2017. This is a landmark legislation in terms of making the government accountable for a socioeconomic right ‚Äì the ‚Äúright to access mental health care.‚Äù

Psychiatric epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of mental illness frequency in human beings, with the fundamental aim of understanding and controlling the occurrence of mental illness. Psychiatric epidemiology deals with important components such as disease/disorder, distribution, and frequency of disease/disorder, determinants of disease/disorder, human population, and methods employed to control the occurrence of illness. 

Mental health problems can attain the disorder/disease/syndrome level, which is usually considered easy to recognize, define, diagnose, and treat. Hence, they can be called, ‚ÄòVisible Mental Health Problems‚Äô in a community. These visible mental health problems are again classified into Major mental disorders and Minor mental disorders. Major mental disorders are easy to recognize and commonly seen in mental hospitals, however, minor mental disorders are common in the community. Another group of mental health problems remains at the sub-clinical/non-clinical/sub-syndromal level and is usually related to the behavior of an individual. They are difficult to recognize, define, and diagnose. Hence, they are called, ‚ÄòInvisible Mental Health Problems‚Äô. Psychiatric epidemiological studies have ignored this category because of the difficulty in defining and identifying the case. It has also been argued by many researchers, not to pathologize the problems faced by the individuals.

The need of the hour is in addressing major challenges such as lack of mental health manpower and stigma, which are the major threats to developing comprehensive psychiatric services in the community.

Persons with Disability have been entitled with certain rights under the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016. This RPWD Act, 2016 promotes and protects the rights and dignity of people with disabilities in various aspects of life ‚Äì educational, social, legal, economic, cultural and political. This act also recognizes medical authorities for assessment and certification of disability . India signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Person with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and subsequently ratified the same on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD proclaims that disability results from an interaction of impairments with attitudinal and environmental barriers which hinders full and active participation in society on an equal basis. Further, the convention also mandates the signatories to change their national laws, to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers, and to comply with the terms of the UNCRPD. In this regard, the Government of India initially undertook the amendment of laws such as Persons with Disability Act, 1995 (PWD Act 1995). The Rights of PWD Act, 2016 (RPWD Act 2016) replaced the PWD Act 1995 to comply with the UNCRPD. The new act was fine-tuned considering the socio-cultural and local needs of the society, and the available resources. Persons with Mental Illness (PMI) are often stigmatized and discriminated, which hinders their full and active participation in society. This is a much larger issue, especially in women, gender minorities, backward communities, and the poor and the migrated populations. Adding to the complexities, PMIs are often not aware of their illness, refuse the much-needed treatment and often are not in a place to exercise their rights. There is an urgent need to address this issue of attitudinal barrier so that the rights of PMI are upheld.

Millions of people are said to be affected by disasters every year in our country. Disasters are inevitable part of our life. Of course, preparing for unexpected occurrences is only part of the equation. Healthcare workers have been a great resource during the emergency response to any disaster. When disaster strikes it‚Äôs important to take precautions for individuals serving in this role. The public health sector requires potentiality and relationships with other sectors. If this relationship is well established before a disaster strikes, this planning and prevention do play crucial role in mitigating the suffering of the survivors. The information obtained from the knowledge and experience of disaster  healthcare workers can be the basis for operational planning of healthcare services in disasters.

Disaster management from mental health perspective is based on the principles of ‚Ä≤preventive medicine‚Ä≤ This principle has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach of health promotion, disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be understood on the basis of six ‚Ä≤R‚Ä≤s such as Readiness (Preparedness), Response (Immediate action), Relief (Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial measures using community resources), Recovery (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering). Prevalence of mental health problems in disaster affected population is found to be higher by two to three times than that of the general population. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbours large number of sub-syndromal symptoms. Majority of the acute phase reactions and disorders are self-limiting, whereas long-term phase disorders require assistance from mental health professionals. Role of psychotropic medication is very limited in preventing mental health morbidity. The role of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in mitigating the mental health morbidity appears to be promising. Role of Psychological First Aid (PFA) and debriefing is not well-established. Disaster management is a continuous and integrated cyclical process of planning, organising, coordinating and implementing measures to prevent and to manage disaster effectively. Thus, now it is time to integrate public health principles into disaster mental health

One of the most exciting features of Sipadan Island is the presence of Turtles. It is very common to see plenty of turtles in one dive. It is a home for Green Turtles and Hawksbill turtles. One more speciality of this island is 'Turtle Tomb'. This is a cave inside the ocean approximately 20meters below. Visit to this tomb requires a special dive which every cave diver must see once in his life! 

Today, 23 May 2016 is a world Turtle day. Save turtle.

Sipadan Island is a shark heaven. Sharks are seen everywhere, each diver gets an awesome opportunity to spot these marvelous beauties. The common saying in Sipadan goes like this, "you have to be blind not to see one here" Due to wrong publicity, sharks have a bad reputation, but they are shy, timid and majestic animals. Many types of sharks are at risk of becoming extinct which is why conservation efforts are in place. They are no human-eating (exclusively)  Sharks. Majority of the Sharks attacks are provoked or mistaken attacks. Sharks are not dangerous, in fact human are most dangerous animal on this planet.

On 13 May 2016, I was very lucky to encounter the Tornado (F1 Category) of Barracuda fishes. This video was captured by Suresh Bada Math  using Hero 4 (Black Edition). The massive number of Barracuda fishes completely blocked the sunlight. You can also find a white tip reef Shark in the middle of the video. Sighting Barracuda fishes in huge schools has become difficult now-a-days. I was lucky enough though.....  I would like to thank  Mr. Sayeed and the Dive India group for organising this trip and also Bensound for providing Royalty free music for the video. The Sipadan island is a marvellous, breathtaking and dream destination for any diver.
